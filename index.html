                Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
                Now
                remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't
                meet,
                they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older
                brother's
                disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you
                will be
                next. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's
                the
                Doc, boy, huh? Doc
            </p>
            <p>
                Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess
                they
                call you Cal, huh? Doc. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard,
                you
                killed a pine. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's
                where they kiss for the first time. What?
            </p>
            <p>
                But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.
                Thank
                god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Your, your right. What? Perfect,
                just
                perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Of course, the
                Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first
                time. We all make mistakes in life, children Yeah. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do now. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.
                Don't
                tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? whoa, this is it, this
                is
                the part coming up, Doc.
