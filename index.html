            <h4 id="overviewHcontent">Topic</h4>
            <p>
                What we propose as a team is for UNC Subs to become an application/website where consumers can pay for
                their streaming subscription services on a centralised platform so that it reflects as a single payment
                rather than multiple. You will be able to manage all your subscriptions in one place. You can access the
                platform on any iOS and Android device. And any web browser (excluding internet explorer).
            </p>
            <p>
                The outcome of our initial project was to have a centralised subscription service platform. However, we
                concluded that more is needed to envision the goal that we have in mind. We are providing a platform
                that is easy for all users. The main requirement is time efficiency, so we have implanted the ability to
                include streaming those services on UNC Subs. The outcome is to provide a product that is effective for
                users and does not require individual apps to watch their favourite shows on different applications.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                Our entire motivation behind this particular "project idea" is that we do not appreciate having
                subscriptions withdrawn from our personal bank accounts on different monthly dates. The continuous
                build-up of separate, difficult-to-track charges makes budgeting significantly more complex than
                necessary. It is not enjoyable! We want to create a service where all your subscriptions are captured
                within one payment at your billing date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Of course, the
                Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first
                time. We all make mistakes in life, children Yeah. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do now. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.
                Don't
                tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? whoa, this is it, this
                is
                the part coming up, Doc.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Landscape</h4>
            <p>
                We currently have an existing competitor, which is Optus. They have a platform which is called Optus
                SubHub. Users can subscribe to subscription services through Optus SubHub. The differences between our
                product UNC Subs and Optus SubHub are that you can only subscribe to the selectively chosen services
                within their platform, you cannot add your own subscription platform and nor can you watch the services
                within their platform; you must externally access the website to be able to watch subscriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team saw Optus SubHub as a competitor, and we wanted to increase further what it is users can do
                within our platform verse Optus SubHub specifically being subscription based only. We've eliminated
                multiple applications being a prerequisite, simplifying the streaming experience for consumers.
