                Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Well,
                Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. McFly. Precisely. Um, well
                it's a delorean, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it
                up on your way to the mall? Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of
                Einstein and the car are completely intact. Right, I got it. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming
                up, Doc.
            </P>
            <p>
                No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot,
                you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Doc,
                you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? I had a horrible
                nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And
                this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always
                saying. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
