                Our group reflection has not remarkably changed from Assignment 2; however, they are key differences
                that have made us grow as a team together. We initially talked about how well we had worked together as
                a team, how friendly we were from the beginning, and willing to work together to achieve the best
                outcome possible. Each group member was receptive and open about our strengths and areas needing more
                support. People with different personalities were willing to do their part to the best of their
                abilities. We collaborated
                and allocated the work also worked well in the way that group members volunteered to contribute as much
                as they could.

                What we have done differently from Assignment 2 for Assignments 3 and 5 is continue our weekly meetings.
                However, with our weekly meetings that we have continued to do, we have set specific tasks set for every
                single team member. The team also implemented deadlines for work required to be completed other than
                chasing up every member. Teams chemistry within the team had to change due to the removal of a member
                and a new one having to join us. Matthew is an asset to the team, considering he had to start fresh with
                a new project idea. He worked well with us, especially with his communication and the work he provided
                to the team. We are thrilled with our decision to take him along.

                As stated in Assignment 2,"An area where the group could improve is time management; having different
                schedules and working remotely through Microsoft teams sometimes cause difficulty communicating between
                members about deadlines and work submissions. "The team collectively prevented this from happening again
                due to the new scheduling system and deadlines system we had partaken into place, we originally wanted
                to use Trello however it never fell through.
                Overall, the team has agreed that there is nothing to improve. Everyone has provided excellent work and
                made an effort to attend meetings. If they could not, as we all have busy schedules, we made sure for
                everyone to be up to date with what it is that was required to be complete, and also, others who missed
                out on meetings would ensure to reach out to the team members on what is required to be done.

                We had to adjust to the removal of our previous team member, and with our new team member joining us, at
                first, we were hesitant as we were from the start when we initially started as a group. However, after
                our initial introductions with Matthew, we got along immediately as if he was with us for Assignment 2.
                Nevertheless, we were surprised by how supportive everyone was and eager to help each other and,
                overall, how positive the collaborative experience was especially considering we were strangers. Some
                team members were also surprised by how difficult of an application the Microsoft team was to use and
                navigate, still needing help to use Microsoft Teams after our final assessment due to the app's
                glitches.
