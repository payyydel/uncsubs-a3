                Common feedback received from the group reflection about how we worked well together talked about how
                friendly we all were from the beginning and willing to work together as a group to all achieve the best
                outcome possible. Each member of the group was receptive and open about our strengths and the areas we
                may
                need more support. We collaborated and allocated the work also worked well in the way that group members
                volunteered to contribute as much as they could. People with different personalities were willing to do
                their part to the best of their abilities. We also worked well together during the weekly calls as we
                effectively communicated any areas of concern and built chemistry with each other. The work submitted
                was
                also cohesive and decisive despite being written by six different supportive people.

                An area where the group could improve is time management; having different schedules and working
                remotely
                through Microsoft teams sometimes cause difficulty communicating between members about deadlines and
                work
                submissions. To improve this, the team will have more specific and detailed time frames and deadlines
                for
                assessment three. We will do this using "Trello", which allows team members to add and check off items
                on a
                to-do list, making it easier to keep each other accountable. Another possible solution to this we will
                implement will be the use of collaborative documents where team members can see real-time changes in the
                work and work as a unit rather than independently.
            </p>

                Team members were surprised by how welcoming and pleasant everyone was to each other, which isn't always
                the
                case in group projects. The familiarity and acceptance helped every member feel comfortable and
                confident to
                speak up. We were surprised by how supportive everyone was and eager to help each other and, overall,
                how
                positive the collaborative experience was especially considering we were complete strangers. Some team
                members were also surprised by how difficult of an application Microsoft team was to use and navigate.
