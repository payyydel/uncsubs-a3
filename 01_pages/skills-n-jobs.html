                Generally typecast as the leader, the CEO will be responsible for the company's success, as well as its
                failures. Playfully considered "The Dreamer", the CEO will bring passion and belief in the core idea of
                the platform, what it stands for, and what it can do. They will be responsible for the day-to-day
                operations as well as long-term growth. The CEO will have a legally binding, ethical duty to ensure all
                company practices meet industry standards ethically; they will coordinate all teams with a stoic and
                passionate sense of leadership, as well as partner with the CPO in vendor pursuits for opening
                subscription service offers.

                The CPO will be the tactical leader of the company, responsible for the execution of the
                product/platform from early development to launch and beyond. They will need to coordinate with others
                to ensure goals are aligned and helm the early stages of marketing. Additionally, a significant
                responsibility will be reaching out to vendors, including all manner of subscription-based services for
                the company to partner with. They will need to build up an impressive roster of partnerships for launch,
                without which the company will ultimately fail.
