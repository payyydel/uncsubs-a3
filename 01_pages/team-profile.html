            <p>
                For Assignment 2, we collectively worked very closely with each other, creating a well-formed
                assessment/project. However, all groups tend to clash and have differences for various reasons, such as
                work commitments, lack of communication etc. And while, given the circumstances, communication left much
                to be desired, going into assessment 3, we've reflected on our evident shortcomings, received feedback,
                and strategised a method to overcome them.

                Omar implemented a new process to actively show who and what is currently being worked on by section,
                with an element of accountability where everyone can actively view and must update their progress as
                they go. Pair that with our weekly check-ins and more consistent communication in teams, draft deadlines
                communicated group-wide in Microsoft Teams, and we've made admirable strides.

            <p>
                When I began this course I had the intention of setting out on working towards a career in cyber security. I may still pursue this career as I have learned a lot about cyber security and it does fascinate me, though I did find that I thoroughly enjoyed the process of building the websites throughout this subject. I’m really excited to dive deeply into programming and see where that takes me. Umera asked me about my study plans and whether I would do a Bachelor of IT or Computer Science. I had expected to continue through Information Technology, but it was when she expressed that she felt that I would be able to handle the Computer Science pathway and how much I enjoyed building the websites, it had me thinking CS might end up being more of my interest. I’m unsure where exactly my studies will take me, but I’m sure I’m on the right path for the future of my career never the less.

                As stated in assignment 2, my career plan of pursuing the title of software engineer has changed to become a Cybersecurity Analyst and ideally have experience in the penetration testing field of cyber security. Throughout the course, I found myself to be more intrigued in understanding security measures and how hackers operated compared to developing software. This became more apparent during the week eleven webinar with Thomas as he taught us how to hack, stay safe and some key fundamentals. Furthermore, with recent cyber attacks happening, the demand for experts within cyber security will undoubtedly increase.
