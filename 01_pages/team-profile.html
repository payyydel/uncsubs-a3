            <h1>Group Processes</h1>
            <p>
                For Assignment 2, we collectively worked very closely with each other, creating a well-formed
                assessment/project. However, all groups tend to clash and have differences for various reasons, such as
                work commitments, lack of communication etc. And while, given the circumstances, communication left much
                to be desired, going into assessment 3, we've reflected on our evident shortcomings, received feedback,
                and strategised a method to overcome them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Omar implemented a new process to actively show who and what is currently being worked on by section,
                with an element of accountability where everyone can actively view and must update their progress as
                they go. Pair that with our weekly check-ins and more consistent communication in teams, draft deadlines
                communicated group-wide in Microsoft Teams, and we've made admirable strides.

            <br>

            <p>
                The team has had a shift of job changes throughout the course. Kamille’s initial interest was in Cyber
                Security, which remains the same. Clyde was initially interested in Software Engineering; however, as
                the course progressed, he showed internet in the Cyber Security Field like Kamille. Omar initially
                desired to be at IT Support Desk at Schools, but he has also developed an interest in Cyber Security.
                However, Matthew was initially interested in starting in Cyber Security, but after he has experienced
                programming within Assignments 2 and 3, he is now more interested in Programming. Joshua is still
                staying within his field of Software Engineering. He became interested in cyber security and wished to
                expand into Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, lastly, Molly wishes to continue
                her interest in Artificial Intelligence but also pursue a degree in Finance as she is showing interest
                in FinTech.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team had quite the changes and choice differences, with many changing their decisions due to their
                interest in the work introduced within the course via Lectures, Coursework, and Assignments.

            <p>
                When I began this course I had the intention of setting out on working towards a career in cyber
                security. I may still pursue this career as I have learned a lot about cyber security and it does
                fascinate me, though I did find that I thoroughly enjoyed the process of building the websites
                throughout this subject. I’m really excited to dive deeply into programming and see where that takes me.
                Umera asked me about my study plans and whether I would do a Bachelor of IT or Computer Science. I had
                expected to continue through Information Technology, but it was when she expressed that she felt that I
                would be able to handle the Computer Science pathway and how much I enjoyed building the websites, it
                had me thinking CS might end up being more of my interest. I’m unsure where exactly my studies will take
                me, but I’m sure I’m on the right path for the future of my career never the less.

            <p>
                As stated in assignment 2, my career plan of pursuing the title of software engineer has changed to
                become a Cybersecurity Analyst and ideally have experience in the penetration testing field of cyber
                security. Throughout the course, I found myself to be more intrigued in understanding security measures
                and how hackers operated compared to developing software. This became more apparent during the week
                eleven webinar with Thomas as he taught us how to hack, stay safe and some key fundamentals.
                Furthermore, with recent cyber attacks happening, the demand for experts within cyber security will
                undoubtedly increase.

                After the second assignment my ideal job has been influenced during the progression of the course
                however I am still currently on the fence since I do genuinely want to have an opportunity with my ideal
                job as it is what I truly desire to do, however long term potentially Cyber Security is what I’ll end up
                potentially following into. This is due to the uprising of recent cyber-attacks that have occurred and
                to have the ability to prevent these from happening I wish to be a part of this future.

            <p>
                My area of interest remains, at least for the time being, in software development. Throughout the course
                and assessments, I’ve been exposed a lot more to the inner workings of varying areas of IT, and as such,
                I’m primarily interested in a career in the field of AI/ML. My interests also lie in Cyber Security;
                however, I believe that working in the field of artificial intelligence, ideally as an AI/ML software
                engineer, would benefit countless parts of the industry, including cyber security. It seems like a
                no-brainer, with plenty of options to flex. The Introduction to Information Technology course and,
                overall, Bachelor of information technology degree is acting as a significant stepping-stone. I’m
                planning to specialise in the near future with my goal in mind.

            <p>
                Coming to the end of this course my area of interest remains to be in artificial intelligence, however,
                over the course of the assignment and through research into crypto technologies and other research
                outside of university I have realised how interested I am in the financial and FinTech industry. So much
                so that I am considering making my computer science degree a double degree in finance. The way
                technology is yet to be utilised in social enterprises is also a strong interest of mine, I think
                technology has a huge potential to help a lot of people and I’d like to help fulfill that even if it
                might not be the most lucrative career path to take.
