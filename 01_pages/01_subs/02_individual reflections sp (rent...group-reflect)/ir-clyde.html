            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one
                of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already
                know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby
                Joey. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Nothing's coming
                to my mind. What?
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Alright, okay
                listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your
                mind, George? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Y'know this time it
                wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. You want it, you know you want
                it, and you know you want me to give it to you.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a
                portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on
                television. What was it, George, bird watching? Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you
                two. And he could sleep in my room. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
                Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? I haven't Where? In that case, I'll tell you strait out. About 30 years,
                it's a nice round number.
