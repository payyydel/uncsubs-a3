            <h1>What is your aim?</h1>
            <p>
                We aim to provide a service through a mobile app and website that allows consumers to easily manage all
                their subscriptions on a centralised platform. By doing so, consumers will be billed a single payment
                rather than multiple, allowing for effective budgeting and less hassle dealing with subscriptions. With
                this aim, we want to create a valuable and practical service that solves a problem that many people find
                relatable.

            <h1>What goals need to be fulfilled to reach our aim?</h1>
            <h1>Creating an App and Website </h1>
            <p>
                Our first goal should be envisioning the structure of our app and website and taking steps to construct
                it. This will be at the forefront of our efforts because it will be paramount to testing our services,
                ensuring that the user experience is smooth sailing. Furthermore, with a working app and website, we
                will be more likely to close collaboration deals with companies since we have evidence to show we are a
                legit business that has the capabilities to perform our service.

            <h1>Contacting and Collaborating</h1>
            <p>
                A crucial goal to execute is to contact and do business with big-name companies such as Netflix, Amazon,
                Spotify, etc. To add on, we will also need to perform the same task with subscription-based product
                companies such as Athletic Greens, Scratch, Goodie Boxes, and more in order to prepare for phase 2. The
                goal of contacting and successfully collaborating with big-name companies is imperative to our business
                success since we aim to provide a system to effortlessly manage subscriptions that people already have.
                By collaborating, we can legally integrate the various companies into our service and have subscription
                licensing and access to data.

            <h1>Integrating and Validating Subscriptions</h1>
            <p>
                Another vital goal is to integrate and validate subscriptions effectively and securely to ensure optimal
                user experience. This means that we, as a team, will need to create a system to allow users to connect,
                subscribe/unsubscribe, and calculate all their subscriptions by coding or using third-party plugins.
                Additionally, to validate subscriptions, we will need to incorporate bank verification that involves the
                user inputting the correct amount taken from their bank. All these steps to achieving this goal are
                providing quality customer experience and ensuring people don't exploit our services.

            <h1>Successful Marketing</h1>
            <p>
                This goal refers to promoting our service through ads that would be displayed on various platforms such
                as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, paid influencers and even on television. By marketing our service, we
                can target a broad online audience who are most likely to use and find our subscription hub useful.
                Without marketing, we could expect to see slow growth in the number of users for our service and will be
                unable to make ourselves known. If things don't go as expected, we will fall back on this part of the
                plan.

        <section class="descsubs-content">
            <h1>What are the most important parts of the project?</h1>
            <p>
                The most important parts of the project would be gaining as many collaborations as possible and having a
                working platform to host our service on. This is because UNC Subs is a service provider focused on
                helping users easily manage their subscriptions. Without a variety of collaborations, users may be
                discouraged from using our service due to limited options and versatility. Furthermore, we cannot
                integrate these subscriptions anywhere without a running app or website.

        <section class="descsubs-content">
            <h1>Which parts should have priority over the others?</h1>
            <p>
                As stated before, the most crucial goal would be contacting and partnering with as many companies as
                possible. However, focusing more time and effort trying to close deals with well-known companies is a
                greater priority than closing deals with lesser-known companies. Having more well-known companies
                integrated with our service makes us more trustworthy, and people are more likely to be already
                subscribed, which can be an incentive to use our subscription hub to manage them.

            <h1>If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?</h1>
            <p>
                As a team, we believe that if we only have enough time or resources for one of our goals, it should be
                directed towards contacting and collaborating with subscription-based companies. This is because,
                without these companies, our service would be deemed impractical as there would be no subscriptions to
                manage. To add on, we could outsource the other necessary tasks, such as creating an app/website by
                hiring experts, allowing for more time dedicated to building relationships.
