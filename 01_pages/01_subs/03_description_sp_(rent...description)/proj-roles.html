                In this project, most members have roles that align with their strengths and interests. These roles were
                not explicitly defined and allocated; however, as the project progressed, members established themselves
                in specific positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Product Manager, the person who supervises all aspects of the project development process, is Omar.
                A Product Manager's range of responsibilities is quite diverse. Omar's duties during the project as
                Product Manager include controlling and planning tasks, leading, and facilitating meetings,
                collaborating with developers, and generating ideas. Omar also initiated the project idea. Omar has
                taken on other typical duties of a Product Manager during this process, including accepting and
                rejecting ideas and facilitating technical documentation and maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this role, a Business Analyst acts as a bonding agent between the market and engineers, outlining the
                target audiences' needs and analysing their behaviour and concerns to pass this to the engineers. The
                role fits Kamille as her work in assignment one interviewing Kamille demonstrated interest in risk
                management, group processes and communication. She brings strong organisational, analytical and
                communication skills, which are all vital responsibilities of a Business Analyst as this role suits
                someone comfortable working and liaising with a wide range of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another essential role in a software development team is a Tester, who handles the manual part of the
                testing stage, reflecting the users operating habits and patterns. The role has been assigned to Matt
                because Matthew has shown interest in testing, verification, and work in this area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Engineering Manager of the team is Josh. As a manager, this role works with every team member and
                understands the teams' performance dynamics well. As Engineering Manager, Josh provides coaching and
                answers any software questions the team may have. The Engineering Manager also optimises the software
                development team structure when new developers join the team. This role requires a solid technological
                background and confidence in choosing the best engineering solutions, both of which Josh has
                consistently shown throughout his work.

                Clyde will take on the role of User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) designer in our team. This role
                helps create user-friendly interfaces that ensure users can use the product or service. It is a good
                role for Clyde because he is passionate about the latest technology trends and devices and likes working
                with the end users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, Molly is taking on the role of Quality Assurance or QA Engineer. This role requires attention
                to detail in creating and running tests and ensuring the product is free from bugs and issues. The QA
                Engineer works closely with the Engineering Manager and Tester to ensure the product is ready to launch.
