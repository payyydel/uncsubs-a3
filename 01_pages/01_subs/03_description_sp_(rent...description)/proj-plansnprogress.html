            <h1>Our Platform</h1>
            <p>
                The fundamental function of our project idea is to improve the accessibility of subscription-based
                entertainment streaming services to all users by creating a centralised hub for payments. Building upon
                that also acts as a primary hub for accessing the content the users are paying for, whether audio or
                video-based services. The services that our platform will have available will have complete coverage to
                not only incorporate entertainment streaming subscription services like Disney+, Netflix and Spotify, to
                name a few but also learning subscription services such as Skill-Share, Masterclass and for book lovers,
                audiobook services such as Audible and Blinkist among others. Our platform will be a uniquely
                diversified CenterPoint for a wide range of services that is unprecedented.

            <p>
                Partnerships with streaming subscription services will be integral to our business model. We will not
                only require our platform to be a payment option through the subscription services platforms but also
                allow us to access and display their content on our platform. The way we would secure these partnerships
                would be to form business relationships by organising meetings and discussing the goals we have for our
                company and what ideas we have that will significantly benefit their customers and their companies
                (Masterclass 2021). Agreements would need to be put into place that would detail many important clauses
                regarding how we would promote their services, how profits would be shared, and each company's
                responsibility to each other in the partnership, to name a few.

            <h1>What will it do?</h1>
            <p>
                The platform our team is designing will allow users to have full functionality of their favourite
                services from one convenient location. This ease of access will be available from our web application as
                well as our mobile app. Users of our platform will be able to subscribe to as many of the partnered
                streaming services as they wish. If a service is no longer required, users can unsubscribe from any of
                the services with the same ease as it was to subscribe in the first place. This allows users to only pay
                for what they need and when they need it. The appeal of this feature is that it will save money on
                unutilised subscriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                To continue adding to our platform's convenience, users can view or listen to the content of their
                subscribed services using our embedded media player. This is where users can choose any content from
                their subscriptions to enjoy on our platform in one convenient location. The platform interface will
                have a list of tiles displaying the options for the content of the subscripted services the user has to
                choose from. This will vary from user to user as the services are ultimately left up to the user to
                select.

                We will design a user interface that is user-friendly and visually pleasing. This will need to be
                designed and implemented across multiple languages such as Object C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to
                allow for a consistent UI experience when cross-platforming between iOS, Android, and Web browsers.

                With machine learning, we will gather information on our users to improve our user experience by
                recommending new entertainment and subscription options based on the content determined by the users'
                history. The way the algorithm will decide what to recommend will be based not only on history but other
                variables such as playtime, category, and repetition, which will include continuously played episodes of
                a particular series, whether it be audio or video. A more generalised recommendation list will also be
                made available where more significant amounts of data will be collected by all users, which will suggest
                the most popular content based on the user's location and gender.

                Recommendations will be displayed on the home screen of our platform, where the subscriptions that users
                have subscribed to are displayed. This will have a unique user interface, as it will open the doors to
                all the subscription options available by displaying content of all the options available from one
                place. This will serve two purposes preventing the user from feeling as if they have to navigate
                multiple subscriptions, thereby increasing user experience satisfaction and allowing for that grandstand
                type feeling of a giant hub of content which will also serve the same purpose.

                The registration process that users of our platform will experience will be aligned with the main
                principle of our platform, which is ease and simplicity. Users will start the sign-up process like any
                other platform by entering their nominated email address and creating a password. From there, users will
                be given the option to select their preferred payment method, such as direct debit via debit or credit
                card.

            <h1>How will we enable these payment options?</h1>
            <p>
                Payment options will be supported methodically. Beginning by creating a registered business. This can be
                done through an accounting firm registering our business details and providing us with an Australian
                Business Number and an Australian Company Number. This process will legally allow our business to
                operate in Australia and pay the appropriate taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the use of the ABN and ACN, we will then secure a business merchant banking account and a payment
                gateway. Most banks in Australia offer merchant accounts that are packaged together with payment
                gateways. A payment gateway is necessary as it is a secure service for websites and applications to
                receive payments, which acts like a digital card reader.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users will have to agree to have their payment information saved on our platform. Once payment
                information is secured, our platform will confirm the payment details by making a small charge to the
                users' nominated payment option. Users will then be asked to provide evidence of these transactions by
                telling us precisely the amounts charged. As soon as this confirmation has been completed, the
                confirmation charges will be reversed, being processed immediately. This will allow for monthly billing
                and allow for ease of adding new services to their subscription.

            <p>
                A platform that is based on payments and user information so heavily, it is undoubtedly expected that
                security is an extremely important factor for us to consider. This is the reason for the confirmation of
                the payment method. The process we require our users to go through provides proof of ownership of the
                bank account related to the payment method they provide, reducing the risk of fraud.

                To further ensure the security of our users' information, it will be necessary and expected by our users
                that we have all their payment and personal information that we keep encrypted for their safety. We will
                ensure this by implementing a Security Sockets Layer internet security protocol on our platform. Our
                team will do this by obtaining an SSL Certificate. With the use of SSL, we will ensure that our user's
                information is safe with 256-bit encryption.

                After finalising registration and payment, users will select which services they would like to subscribe
                to. Once a service is selected, users will be directed to the service provider's linked website. This is
                where users will have the option to either sign up for that service; or, if it is a service that is
                already a subscription held by the user, in both instances, they will have the option to choose their
                payment preference to be charged through our platform. This will be made possible by the partnerships
                our platform will have gained with the services that are then made available to our users.

            <h1>Payment</h1>
            <p>
                We expect that many of the users of our platform will already have a hand full of subscriptions to some,
                if not many, of the popular streaming services. That's why, again, we have made the transition to our
                platform as convenient as possible, thanks to the partnerships that will be established with the
                streaming services we offer. Should users join our platform at any point through their current
                subscription period, the transition period will be charged at a pro-rata rate. For instance, a user has
                three subscription services they are currently paying for, billed on the 2nd,15th, and 29th of the
                month. The user will select the preferred payment date for their combined subscription on our platform,
                which may be the 30th of each month.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than being billed the total amount, users will be billed at a pro-rata rate for the duration of
                the month. This will be calculated by calculating the monthly fee over 30 days as a percentage and then
                taking away the percentage value of the days left in the month. For a $10 subscription billed from the
                2nd to the 30th, the user will be charged $9.24. For a $15 subscription billed from the 15th to the
                30th, the user will be charged $7.50, and for a $20 subscription billed from the 29 to the 30th, the
                user will be billed $0.66. This will allow all the users to merge the accounts for the duration of the
                month. This will be calculated by calculating the monthly fee over 30 days as a percentage and then
                taking away the percentage value of the days left in the month. For a $10 subscription billed from the
                2nd to the 30th, the user will be charged $9.24. For a $15 subscription billed from the 15th to the
                30th, the user will be charged $7.50, and for a $20 subscription billed from the 29 to the 30th, the
                user will be billed $0.66. This will allow all the users to merge the accounts of their favourite
                subscription services into a billing date that suits them best.

            <h1>Marketing</h1>
            <p>
                As with any successful product, our team must create and implement a strong marketing strategy. There
                are opportunities to take a more modern approach, as attention has dramatically shifted towards digital
                devices. It is no secret that as social media have evolved, attention spans have drastically reduced.
                Our team has identified the importance of embracing and using this understanding to create a marketing
                campaign based on social media and fast-paced content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Media analysts and Data Scientists have identified that the typical attention span of social media
                consumers is an average of 8 seconds (Kraus Group Marketing 2022). Therefore, our strategy is to design
                advertising that communicates our message within this time frame. This aligns with our platform's "no
                time to waste" values and is marketing to the demographic of people who are time constrained and will
                likely see the most benefit in consolidating their entertainment with our platform.

            <h1>Tell us about the ''story'' of your project – how it began, how it has progressed, and what stage of the
                plan you are up to.</h1>
            <p>
                The origin of our project idea started during assessment 2. We had to collectively decide whose project
                idea we would use as a team. We all had shown each other's project idea to every team member and
                concluded that Omar's original project idea would be what we used for assessments 2 and 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our earliest project idea was to be the creation of an application/website where consumers can pay for
                their subscription services, such as Netflix, Amazon, Spotify etc., on a centralised platform so that it
                reflects as a single payment rather than multiple. All subscriptions will charge via the service as per
                their regular billing date, culminating in a single charge from a chosen bank account or credit/debit
                card. Simply select the subscription service you desire, then add it to your account to be billed each
                month, and you can choose any service as you please. You will be able to manage all your subscriptions
                in one place. You'll be able to access the platform on any iOS and Android device. And any web browser
                (excluding internet explorer).
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the project's original idea that Omar had created; however, we saw a greater potential here.
                Considering that the project idea was to create a more manageable platform for managing payments for
                subscriptions so users did not have to manage the individual services and payments coming out at
                different times of the month. We also wanted to incorporate the streaming service aspect into the
                platform, becoming an all-in-one design. In contrasting hindsight, the original idea had that element of
                convenience, not having to manage each subscription; however, you still had to log onto their website
                and watch their show there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our primary motivation and goal were saving the user time and ease of use for all apps and platforms.
                This saves users from having numerous logins for multiple platforms, right? And having to access
                multiple websites and even not requiring having multiple apps anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are developing the project idea further in the implementation stage, as this will be a future
                update/content for our users. An exciting endgame goal of ours is exploring the option of further
                implementing utility bills where you can assign what bills you want to come out within the same
                timeframe. Furthermore, considering the billing nature of quarterly utility bills, you would be unable
                to place them into a month-to-month billing system. We will give you the power to group up the bills
                that come out within the same timeframe as each other to be detracted from your account automatically.
                It's a more rigid system to implement because not all bills are monthly, as they would have to align
                with each other.

                you have done and are planning to do.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Initially, the project idea was to create a centralised platform through which users would keep track of
                subscription payments; however, over time, the concept developed to include a broader range of
                integrated subscription services. This project idea eventually evolved into a service where users stream
                their services via our platform instead of managing payments. The concept was then developed to
                integrate machine learning into our platform using an AI algorithm to receive data on what the users are
                watching—achieved through surveys to build a profile about the user through their data and what this
                says about their behaviour and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then realised this data collected could also be used to provide more targeted product-based
                subscriptions through a different segment of the app and website. We then introduced the facility, which
                will feature products from a range of companies that use a subscription-based model and enables users to
                browse and subscribe monthly subscriptions to trusted companies such as Scratch, Athletic Greens or
                Hello Fresh.
            </p>
            <p>
                A "dead-end idea" we had to scrap was "goodie boxes". Initially, we planned to include monthly
                subscriptions to these boxes, which we wouldn't sell as we would only feature pre-existing products
                already available to customers, such as candy care packages or beauty and health care boxes. Initially,
                implementing this feature would save time and hassle for users already subscribed to product-based
                companies. However, after further thought, we decided not to follow this direction. We wanted to focus
                our efforts on the core product and platform without introducing physical products. Introducing physical
                products might also be a distraction from the primary business. In this way, we made UNC Subs an
                exclusively digital platform that helps focus our vision and strategy.

                <i>If it helps, imagine the information that would be required if you were to hand this project over at
                    the end of the semester to a new team to complete the job. What would you want to know if you were
                    one of the people taking over? - (Clyde)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were one of the people taking over UNC's project, there would be a long list compiled of questions
                surrounding the vision, strategies, and health of the business. My first questions would focus on
                gaining a deeper understanding of UNC's long-term vision for its service and motivation. By doing so, I
                can gauge the practicality of the goal, determine if it is scalable and even refine certain aspects to
                my liking. Furthermore, a grasp of the company's end goal and a "why" factor for doing so will assist
                me, and the team overcomes the challenges we will face as we build strategic steps toward our shared
                objective.
            </p>
            <p>
                A crucial part of the business is the current strategies to fulfil this goal. An essential strategy to
                be inspected would be the method of acquiring partnerships with companies and the outcomes of utilising
                it. In doing so, I can read over the agreements and terms and conditions within the contract and observe
                how many companies UNC successfully and unsuccessfully secured with this approach. Furthermore, the
                range of programming languages, software, and hardware implemented, including the challenges the team
                faced in creating the interface for the service, with security systems in place and how they protect
                UNC, along with the customer's experience and personal information. Lastly, I expect the current team to
                have backup procedures handy for me, as it shows the team is serious and prepared for contingencies.
                Examining UNC's backup plan, partnership, and innovation strategies would be a must as it would allow me
                to see if they are applicable during unfavourable events, learn from their experiences, and have a
                foundation to build on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I need to familiarise myself with the business's health and understand its current operating
                system. I need to know the financial side, including the business's operating expenses, how they
                monetise the service for profit, assets, liabilities, and other related figures. Further information
                would include the number of workers employed, their roles, the number of current active monthly users,
                and customer reviews. Lastly, who the major competitors are within the industry in order to plan and
                incorporate a moat that makes us stand out from them.

            <p>
                <b>Operating System -</b> Pre-Installed Mac-based Operating System, the latest version of Mac OSX, at
                the time of writing being Monterey, will be utilised. In the event that an alternate OS is requested,
                approved OS options include Windows 10/11 and a variation of the Linux OS. Due to the open-sourced
                nature of Linux OS, we've included a list of approved distros. Alternate preferences can be requested,
                provided they meet all the necessary requirements.

            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>IDEs -</b> Integrated development environments for source code editing. An approved list of IDEs will
                be provided below; however, if a coder has a particular editor in mind, they can submit a request,
                provided it meets compatibility requirements with our chosen mode of version control and supports HTML5,
                CSS3 and JavaScript for web development endeavours; Object-C and Swift for iOS platforms and Java for
                Android-based operating systems.
            </p>
            <p id="desclists">Approved IDEs</p>

            <p>
                <b>Proto.io -</b> Proto.io will be used for mock artifact creation. Proto.io has an extensive range of
                predetermined mock creation tools. Ranging from UI components, audio, and icon libraries to entire
                templates, with a very intuitive and user-focused interface, supporting everything from functionality
                integration to design.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Google Chrome -</b> This one is relatively straightforward but a web browser. Access to all major web
                browsing platforms such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Firefox is necessary to ensure
                code compatibility across all major platforms or alternate methods for unsupported browsers. However,
                Google Chrome will be all that is required when actively debugging or hosting to view live changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Secure Pay -</b> A payment gateway will be paramount in supporting our customers in their
                subscription billing cycles from a centralised point. Therefore, we've chosen to go with one of the most
                highly regarded vendors today, "Secure Pay". Secure Pay offers an impressive level of security features
                surrounding encryption and fraud detection. Furthermore, its virtual terminal is easily integrated,
                fully customisable and provides a sandbox mode for testing prior to launch. Most desirably, it is
                designed purposefully for recurring payments and supports all major card vendors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Amazon Web Services -</b> AWS (IaaS) will be used as a cost and time-effective alternative to
                off-site servers, with us being able to rent out infrastructure from AWS's substantial data centres,
                which would all be done via the cloud. We will have access to a wide range of developer tools on a
                pay-only-for-what-you-use basis. Included are software development kits, continuous integration and
                delivery, code editors, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, data privacy is ensured via identity and access management, data and infrastructure
                protection, compliance and data privacy, threat detection and continuous monitoring. AWS has a
                user-friendly interface to create an easy-to-use platform which is also a flexible and cost-effective
                option. The accessibility and reliability of AWS for less experienced users are some of the main reasons
                we chose to use it when constructing our website.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h1>Required Hardware</h1>
            <p>
                A number of high-end, heavy workload-enabled desktops and laptops will be required to work on varying
                web development, app building and creative-based undertakings. Personal devices will not be permitted as
                they won't have any form of device management protocols present, and we do not wish to overtake personal
                devices. As such, we've chosen a combination of the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch M1 Pro for
                programming-based tasks and the Apple Mac Studio M1 Ultra for creative design and marketing-based tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MacBook Pro makes a serious leap in processing and compiling even the most complex code. It brags
                the ability to run code in several varying test environments. It possesses a sturdier design with
                improved cooling, improved biometric security, a more tactile keyboard, any manner of project essential
                ports and a larger edge-to-edge, variable refresh rate O-LED display powered by machine learning with
                the intention of adapting to fit environment, circumstantial and habitual-based factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mac Studio, on the other hand, is a compact powerhouse in its own right. Purposefully designed for
                high rendering projects, UI and graphic design, as well as any manner of varying creative applications.
                Furthermore, the MacBook Pro M1 Pro supports up to two external 6k displays at a comfortable 60Hz, and
                the Mac Studio M1 Ultra supports up to four external 6k displays also at 60Hz. Both of these will
                provide coders and creatives alike with the flexibility to adapt their workstations to their preferences
                and needs while also allowing coders the option to take their work home with them, should they feel it's
                appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional accessory needs will include a series of monitors and keyboard and mouse accessories. The
                monitors chosen are the Mac Studio Display for creatives and a choice between the LG Dual Up 27-inch
                Ergo or the 49-inch DQHD Ultra Curve. Options in accessories will include Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic
                Mouse or an external Magic Trackpad.

            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <p>
                The testing of an application is best conducted by taking a series of specific steps to ensure all the
                necessary functions of an application run effectively and to the highest degree of security possible. It
                is vital to the development process to ensure that all test measures have been taken in order to deliver
                a product that is operating as intended prior to its release.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h1>Test Process</h1>
            <p>
                In order to sufficiently test our software application, our team will follow testing procedures and
                methods, as well as make use of an IaaS. The processes that we will follow will consist of the following
                steps. Functional testing this is conducted by giving inputs to the individual functions and checking
                the results of the output without considering the coding composition. Usability testing can be performed
                by our team or external users. To find external users, we will make use of services such as Apple's
                TestFlight application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interface testing guarantees that the activity between application server interfaces and web server is
                seamless, including ensuring error alerts are adequately visualised. Compatibility testing, as our
                software will be available on all web browsers (excluding explorer), Android and iOS, we will need to
                test across all these platforms to certify identical functionality is available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using an IaaS such as Real Device Cloud will be a great way to access over 3000 real devices and
                browsers where testing can be carried out manually or automatically. Different Operating Systems will
                also need to be tested to ensure APIs, interface calls, and designs are compatible. Performance testing
                will be carried out after ensuring compatibility. This will be done by stress testing our application
                through different internet speeds to monitor how it will handle regular operation and peak loads. We
                will push the application past its limit to find the breaking point to ensure it will not fail its users
                once made available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Security testing is the final step in our testing process. Our team will test the access to the secure
                pages to make sure that unauthorised access is not possible, restricted files are unable to be accessed
                by unauthorised parties and ensure user inactivity results in open sessions being closed. Following a
                process such as this will cover all aspects of the software, ensuring a stable, reliable and safe
                product for all its users.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h1>Test Method</h1>
            <p>
                As Up & Coming develop our application, we will adhere to the Waterfall methodology. The advantages of
                this method are the steps of the project are completed in sequential order. Each phase of the
                development has particular deliverables and analysis process making it easier for our team to understand
                the requirements at every stage of the project. This will make it easy to know when we have thoroughly
                and successfully tested our software application.

            <h1>Risks</h1>
            <p>
                Creating our project from scratch has its risks. Early identification of these risks, however, will help
                us to mitigate these risks and find solutions for issues that are likely to arise. One of the risks we
                identified is compatibility between platforms. We will be using a Mac-based operating system, and some
                functions may be affected on Windows devices.

                We will be using Proto.io to create the prototype, although, upon further research on the app, we have
                found that the importation of files can be prone to errors and may corrupt files. We are also unfamiliar
                with this software, and it will take time to understand the interface. It could also be difficult to integrate
                other apps to create our product’s interface and functions. The app is also relatively expensive which may cause
                the project prototype creation to be unsustainable.

              One of the integral parts of our project is being able to process multiple transactions as one payment. Secure Pay
              has a good reputation for being customisable and easy to integrate, however, it is possible that errors might occur
              combining subscription models.

                According to Tripwire, most security breaches happen while data is in transit. While most payment
                gateways are secured through encryption between the website and the payment processing system, it is
                still at risk once the data reaches its destination (Tripwire, 2018). Tripwire (2018) cites poor
                security architecture and management, failure to encrypt information such as names, addresses and phone
                numbers and a sole focus on protecting credit card information as common reasons for data breaches. We
                must be mindful of these risks as they not only endanger our future customers but will also damage our
                product's reputation.

                Our product requires integration with the streaming platforms and being able to process subscription
                payments from their members. There is a risk that we may not be able to get approval for these
                platforms. If we are able to partner with these streaming services, we can verify whether they are a
                valid user of the streaming service. If we do get partnerships approved, our users might find that
                streaming through our app is slower than watching or listening to their favourite programs through the
                services' native app.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are some of the risks that we have identified. Though we have not started developing our project,
                it is vital to develop the ability to identify the issues we might face in the future.

                The career website "Indeed" emphasises the importance of being able to pre-empt software risks as it is
                crucial to creating a quality product and meeting our business goals. The Indeed Editorial Team also
                states that we can mitigate the risks by ensuring that we test our codes frequently, resolve bugs and
                logical errors the moment they are found, and set high coding standards for our team.

                During our initial meeting at the beginning of the assessment, our team agreed to meet on Teams through
                chat and video calls. Because most of us have full-time jobs, we scheduled at least one video call per
                week, but this does not hinder us from communicating more frequently to keep each other updated and
                accountable. We all committed to acknowledging and responding to messages on Teams and communicating
                early if our drafts would be late. This way, we can assist each other in problem-solving and ensure that
                our output is of consistent quality and that we can submit projects promptly. In each planning call, we
                spend time reading and understanding the assessment details and what is required from each of us. We
                each leverage our strengths to choose the component that we are best suited to address.
