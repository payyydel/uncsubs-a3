                As a team, we needed help planning and executing the project scope. We have decided to, unfortunately,
                scrap out parts within the project itself because it is unrealistic with the provided time frame given
                to us. We had to ensure what was our priority within our schedule and what was not a priority that could
                be implemented into the next phase/content update. Considering we cannot program the
                website/application, we are required to create artefacts of our project; however, they will not have any
                functionality within the design itself, as a Team Up & Coming. We have collectively decided to create
                the subscription model within our platform. Our main priority and our second priority are implementing
                the streaming service within our platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                The limits of the teams' project plan are within the idea itself. It is because of the simple design and
                how the website will operate. We first have the subscription services themselves, and secondly, we have
                the streaming aspect. The ability to merge all these subscription services into a condensed singular
                platform so users can stream their services is the tricky part, and it is one of our limits. It may be a
                feature in its form that we would have to scrap. However, it is what we desire for our project plan to
                include.
