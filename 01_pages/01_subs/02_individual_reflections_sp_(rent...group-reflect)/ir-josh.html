            <h1>Individual Reflection – Joshua Peddell</h1>
            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                Retrospectively, the team worked remarkably efficiently. There was no hesitation when it came to the
                content contribution, to the point in which team members were offering their services to lighten the
                load where personal circumstances may have hindered someone's original voluntary or assigned sections.
                Communication was clear and concise, and our team leader, Omar, laid out an efficient means by which to
                assign and track progress which worked twofold; requiring members to mark their areas as they went, lest
                they receive a message from Omar. Accountability and transparency were fantastic, with everyone
                professionally utilising Microsoft Teams to provide updates and request completion status and updates.
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                Overall efficiency could have been improved. I firmly believe that we all did excellently considering
                the circumstances; however, across the board, our means of sharing and updating area progress could have
                been better. We definitely could have utilised MS Teams functionality more. Apart from that, I'm pretty
                satisfied with my fellow team members' work and contribution—no further notes from my end.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to my reflection from assessment 2, but something surprising is the lengths people went to
                attend group meetings and complete their work. A prime example is Matthew and Kamille. During A2,
                Kamille was pulling over on the side of the road on her commute home from work to attend and participate
                in group meetings; similarly, Matthew was using his lunch break to join and contribute while working
                shifts that finished at 01:00 in the morning. Dedication was never in short supply with our team.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
                Transparency wins the day. Being honest is the key to an effective team. Transparent regarding your
                capabilities, concerns, even about someone in particular etc. Extrapolating that in a professional
                context, the team leader role acts similar to that of a company CEO. It is as mission-critical as the
                project itself that they bring the passion and set the tone for not only group interactions but the
                overall project from the get-go. A lack of motivation is tantamount to failing to plan and, thereby,
                planning to fail.
