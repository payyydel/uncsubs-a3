            <h1>Individual Reflection – Molly Murray</h1>
            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                I think our group worked really well together everyone in our group wanted to contribute their share and
                pull their weight and I think this really helped when planning, organising, and allocating work. At the
                beginning of the assessment each group member expressed interest in the area they would like to work on,
                and we assigned the work accordingly which ensured we all had clear roles and responsibilities. I was
                also impressed by the quality of the work our group produced and the consistency in the final draft
                although the work was coming from different people.
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                I believe the areas of opportunity from the last assignment improved significantly with this assignment,
                this being time management and organsiation. I think team members made more of an effort to hold each
                other and themselves accountable for submitting work on time and updating the group with drafts and
                posts in the team’s chat. I can’t really think of any other areas of improvement other than using a
                different platform to communicate as sometimes messages were getting lost in the timeline.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                I found it surprising how much of a difference it made to be choosing my own areas and how much more
                enjoyable this made the work. I also found it surprising how much better our group worked together for
                this assessment now that we were familiar with each other, I wasn’t expecting everything to run so
                smoothly. Lastly, I found it surprising how difficult the platform Microsoft teams was to use and how
                for me personally it made the project more difficult as I was often missing announcements by not
                receiving the notifications.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the last three assessments, I have learned that group dynamics can change once you establish
                yourselves in roles, you’re comfortable with, and in my opinion, this improves the way the group works
                together. Reflecting on myself, I have learned that when I work with opinionated people, I tend to
                withdraw quickly which is something I have tried to work on coming into assessments 3 and 5.
