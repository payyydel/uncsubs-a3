            <h1>Individual Reflection – Omar Dalati</h1>
            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                Within our group, the professionalism among the team members and everyone playing a part in the team
                went quite well. Everyone was willing to work together, and nobody refused to play their part. We had
                great banter as we have gotten to know each other even more from A2.
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone from the group held their weight for their work, and others went exceptionally beyond what they
                were currently doing. I applaud all my team members for putting in the time and effort to create our
                final product. We had fantastic communication from everyone. The team members ensured they completed
                their work at the weekly deadlines. However, team members need to make sure to upload work correctly and
                not individually as someone who was creating the pdf document had to chase everyone’s work up when that
                isn’t my responsibility to ensure that your work is in the document when I specifically stated that it
                is required to be uploaded into the main word document.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                We had the removal of a team member from the previous assignment, and we had a new member join us.
                Matthew had been referred to us through Anthony, and I commend someone who was not with us during our
                second assignment and had to adapt to a brand-new project idea. Big props to you!
            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
                I've concluded that I enjoy working in a group where the team members put in as much effort as I put in.
                When you have team members who desire to attain the best possible mark, you'll be able to reach your
                goals. I do not particularly appreciate working within groups; however, this one changed my mind, and I
                desire to cross paths with like-minded people in the future.
