            <h1>Individual Reflection – Clyde Vellescas</h1>
            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                Working with UNC towards the completion of assignment 3 and 5 has been exceptional which I believe is
                the result of the previous assignment and the addition of Matthew Simmons to our group. By taking into
                account the previous assignment, Omar implemented a progression table, firmer deadlines were set and we
                all expected transparency from one another. Furthermore, Matthew was an asset throughout assignment 3
                and 5 and was able to fill in the position and meet the team's standards from day 1. Overall, I believe
                these are the major reasons that enabled our team to work efficiently and smoothly.
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                The only thing I can recall that was an inconvenience was that sometimes, team members would be confused
                about where to submit drafts and work. This trivial issue could have been improved by giving a quick
                rundown during meetings to solve it from the get go.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                One thing I found surprising was the connection I have made with my team. I came into these group
                projects with the expectations of strictly work conversations only but I was mistaken.

            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
                One thing I have learned about groups is how much of an impact a person can be and the influence they
                have to make or break a group. We experienced this first-hand with Harrison as he lacked communication
                and effort and in contrast, Matthew displayed his eagerness to work and ability to achieve expectations.
                Whether they are falling short or achieving, they have a substantial impact on the quality of work and
                team’s vibe.
