            <h1>Individual Reflection – Kamille Acton</h1>
            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                The past few weeks of working with Omar, Josh, Clyde, Molly, and the new addition to UNC – Matthew,
                have been full of excitement. Since most of us have worked together in Assessment 2, communication is
                effortless this time. We have become more open to one another - providing feedback, asking questions,
                and following up with what is needed to complete our tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                Our progress was easily tracked with the excel sheet that Omar created. Perhaps one of the things I hoped
                we could improve on is coming to Team meetings which we all scheduled together on the same day and at the same time.
                As I had some work commitments on the last meeting, I asked the Team to consider having the meeting a day before our usual
                meeting time and everyone agreed. However, not everyone came up and joined. Despite this, our team is still able to complete
                our tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                The members of UNC made it easy to connect, listen to one another’s ideas, and encourage each other to
                achieve a common goal. We committed to fulfilling different sections of the assignment and were responsible
                enough to submit our contributions at the set due date.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
              I used to think working in groups was not doable, especially with doing everything online and never meeting in person.
              We used Teams as a means of communication and a central location where we upload drafts. Through this tool, we could
              easily track what has or has not been done and work on the same files simultaneously.
