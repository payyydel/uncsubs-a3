            <h1>Individual Reflection – Matthew Simmons</h1>
            <h2>What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                I was nervous to come into a new group that had already worked together on the previous assignment, though this was found to be completely unnecessary. Everyone in the group has been extremely welcoming and friendly. I could tell there was a good sense of humour and morale in the group from the first meeting. The group deserves the amazing marks they have received throughout the assignments, as it perfectly reflects their dedication to the work and their technical ability.
            </p>
            <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t particularly have any suggestions for how our group could improve, because I think we have all done excellent work and our meetings have flowed through effortlessly.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
            <p>
                I was surprised by how flexible everyone was with the meeting time and everyone was happy to accommodate my unusual work hours.
            </p>
            <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
            <p>
                From this group experience, I have learned that you don’t always find people who assume everything will be done for them, and it is possible to come across a group of individuals who are happy to pull their weight and commit to a high calibre of work.
