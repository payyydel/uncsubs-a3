            <h1>Joshua Peddell</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Joshua or Josh. I don't really have a preference. My
                student ID is “S3858788”. I’m 22 years old, and like a few of my
                fellow “Up and Coming” or UNC teammates, I have Filipino and Australian
                heritage. I was born and raised on the Northern Beaches of Sydney. I am
                the eldest of 3 to 2 cheeky parents, and I have two gorgeous dogs. I've
                always had a very active interest in coding, and I am in love with the
                progression of technology and its potential for humanity. I'm interested
                in the field of Cyber Security or some variance of development, but I
                haven't quite narrowed that down yet. Outside the course criteria, my
                interests include films, music, comics, and video games. Specifically,
                I really enjoy watching and dissecting all manner of films. Some of my
                all-time favourite directors are Wes Anderson, Edgar Wright, Zac Snyder,
                Steven Spielberg, and Quentin Tarantino. I love varying comic and
                graphic novel types; however, my favourite "genre", as it is, is
                superheroes.
            </p>
