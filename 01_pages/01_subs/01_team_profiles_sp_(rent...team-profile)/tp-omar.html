            <h1>Omar Dalati</h1>
            <p>
                My name's Omar Dalati, student number “S3892747”, and I am 21
                years old. I was born in Australia. However, my parents were
                born in Lebanon, Beirut (Unfortunately, my Arabic is quite
                broken). I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology,
                which I completed at Chisholm Institute in 2019, and the amount
                of knowledge I gained during my time there was incredible.
                Unfortunately, it is 2022, and I've forgotten most of it, but I
                hope this course jogs my memory. And I also had previously
                studied with Swinburne University for a Bachelor of ICT, however,
                I stopped my studies from working full time, so I only roughly
                completed a year's worth of university. My hobbies include video
                games, League of Legends and World of Warcraft, and the occasional
                single-player game and watching anime/reading manga!
