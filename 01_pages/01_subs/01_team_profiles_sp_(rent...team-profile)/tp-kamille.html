            <h1>Kamille Acton</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Kamille Phoebe Enriquez Acton, student number “S3974098”.
                I was born and raised in the Philippines; in 2020, I moved to
                Australia to live and start a family with my partner. I went to
                college and studied for a Bachelor of Arts in English in 2009. Later,
                I took a Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication and graduated in 2013.
                I have not done any other formal education until I enrolled in this
                course. While I was at University, I fell in love with videography. I
                found filming itself was the most memorable part as it felt more like
                hanging out with my friends rather than doing coursework. I still shoot
                short videos here and there to show my friends and family all the
                exciting things I experience upon moving to Australia.
