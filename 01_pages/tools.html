                As a group we have decided to use Proto.io in order to create our prototype version of our iOS Platform
                and also our website platform What it is we used as a group to create our website was our individual
                mark-up software that we chose to code with using HTML and CSS. We have created a GitHub Repository to
                store our HTML and CSS code. It has been published and is currently accessible online and available
                through GitHub Pages, which you can access below.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have included using Excel Spreadsheets in order to track the progression of everyone's set
                section they are set to be completed. Each week we had set specific days / time for drafts / final
                products to be completed as well in order to keep everyone aboard.
                
                Joshua has created the repository, is the owner of the repository and has also given everyone else
                access to make commitments within the GitHub repository, which will be able to reflect on our website on
                GitHub Pages with the link provided below. Joshua has forked Assignment 2

            </p>
            <p>
                Nothing has changed from Assignment 2 regarding communicating as we still have to communicate via
                Microsoft Teams which allowed us to chat and have our weekly meetings regarding the progression of
                Assignment 3. We have been uploading draft documents of our specific tasks, which have been placed
                within the chat room to ensure all information is easily accessible. I have provided links down below to
                our weekly recorded meetings and also our Prototypes.
