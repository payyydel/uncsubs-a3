        <h1>IT Work - Profile</h1>
        <p>
            Greg Acton studied for a bachelor's degree in Information Technology to pursue a career that he could
            genuinely feel passionate about the career path he decided to take. Greg seized upon the opportunity to
            return to university to develop his programming skills when his previous healthcare career did not work out
            as he had planned. Since earning his degree, he has worked as a developer for Services Australia to develop
            various apps, such as an assessment engine for a pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Greg finds getting to the
            crux of an issue and solving problems particularly satisfying. His love of problem-solving has been critical
            in his motivation to develop a new application for his current firm, Rio Tinto.

            Greg has found that software generally takes months to plan and build and often takes time to understand new
            systems. It is imperative to understand these systems before making any changes is not always clear how each
            process is connected. A sound understanding of the systems allows the developer to quickly identify the
            sources of any bugs that may arise during the development process. Greg collaborated with different business
            units and ensured the application was designed for the benefit of each of its users.

            Greg had developed his programming skills from scratch, partly through his study at RMIT. Greg encouraged us
            IT students to persevere through the challenges. Greg emphasized that it is okay to feel discouraged and
            overwhelmed and that we should never hesitate to seek help when needed.
