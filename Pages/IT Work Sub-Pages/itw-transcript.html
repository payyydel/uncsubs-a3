        <h2>Transcript</h2>

        <br />

        <h3>00:07</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Great. So, I think the recordings already started. If you don't know me already, I'm Kamille, and
            I'm in the team with Clyde, who's my interview partner. And just for the record as well, you agree to have
            the interview recorded for our assignment?
        </p>
        <h3>00:28</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Yep, that's fine.
        </p>
        <h3>00:30</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Perfect, thank you. I'd like to start the questions. Could you introduce yourself to us, where
            you're interested in I. T. started and where you are now?
        </p>
        <h3>00:40</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Yeah, sure. So, my name's Greg. By trade, I'm a Java developer, but I'm working with some other
            languages. I've always been interested in computers, but I suppose I switched over to I.T. when my first
            career, which was in healthcare, sort of didn't pan out the way that I expected. So that's when I made the
            switch. And I think I missed the last question.
        </p>
        <h3>01:08</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Where are you currently working, and what kind of role?
        </p>
        <h3>01:13</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Yep. So, I'm at Rio Tinto at the moment, and I guess you could say, sort of in a senior developer
            role. I
            think, yeah.
        </p>
        <h3>01:22</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: That's cool. And what kind of industry is Rio Tinto in?
        </p>
        <h3>01:27</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: It's in mining.
        </p>
        <h3>01:29</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Mining. Awesome, thank you.
        </p>
        <h3>01:33</h3>
        <p>
            Clyde: What other kinds of work do you have to do?
        </p>
        <h3>01:44</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: It's pretty much just development, really. That's my role. I'm sort of a one-man-band in terms of
            that, there's no other developers that I'm working with, so I'm working directly within the business unit.
            So, you could think of them as my clients. So, they use some customized applications within the logistics
            space for planning Rio Tinto's operations, and I work on those applications and support any problems that
            they run into in the production environment.
        </p>
        <h3>02:21</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Awesome, that's so cool. Did you work on any other projects previously? And is it different from
            the current job that you're doing with Rio Tinto?
        </p>
        <h3>02:34</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Well, in terms of other roles that I've had, it's mostly been government, actually. I'd say my first
            real development was on a pharmaceutical benefits scheme. So, on the assessment engine. And I had a few
            other roles since then that were kind of similar. This one's very different because just the nature of the
            application is very different. We use a lot of modelling here, so that's the application that I'm working
            on. So, it's a different problem that it's trying to solve.
        </p>
        <h3>03:51</h3>
        <p>
            Clyde: What aspects of your work do you spend missed time on?
        </p>
        <h3>03:58</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: I'd say it's pretty much just development, really. I mean you could, you could say that analysis and
            production support is part of that picture, but it's all related to bug fixes and enhancement sorts of
            activities. Yeah, and maybe a little bit of consulting as well if someone's got a question about something
            technical.
        </p>
        <h3>04:35</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Do you work with any interesting people in the I.T. sector?
        </p>
        <h3>04:44</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Well, within my role, I just have to work with other I.T. professionals to get stuff done. For
            example, I've got some database changes coming up, so to do that, I'm gonna need to talk to the DBA to do
            that, and I've got some infrastructure stuff that I wanna do for one of the changes, and for that, I'll need
            to talk to someone else. And As for the interactions with our other I.T. professionals, it's only if I need
            to do that for my job.
        </p>
        <h3>05:19</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: So, your work, and pretty much the previous work that you've done for other companies, has been
            very collaborative?
        </p>
        <h3>05:29</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Yeah, it has to be because unless it's a very small company where you look after everything, then
            yeah, it has to be.
        </p>
        <h3>05:38</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Oh, great.
        </p>
        <h3>05:43</h3>
        <p>
            Clyde: Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?
        </p>
        <h3>05:47</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: At the moment, it's the analysis, I think, particularly because I'm relatively new here, and the
            application is very different to what I've worked on before. It can be a challenge to get your head around
            the new system to make changes to it because you know it takes ages to build a system. I think the planning
            one took about six years to build, and the other one was built in about a year. But it's put together in a
            very different way from what I'm used to. So probably the main bit that's difficult is just wrapping your
            head around a new system which is, you know, huge and in the case of the planning one, maybe it's not very
            well put together. So that can be hard. I think that's the main thing, yeah.
        </p>
        <h3>06:35</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: That's the challenge, but my question now is, what's your favourite part of working in the I.T.
            industry?
        </p>
        <h3>06:43</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Problem-solving. That's what I like about it. Yeah, because that's what I liked about my previous
            role. So I just, I guess, targeted something where I could do that all day, and that's what I do all day, so
            it's pretty good.
        </p>
        <h3>06:58</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: What's the biggest project that you've had to use problem-solving that's kind of stuck with you the
            most? If you can share, because I know this is like government stuff, so maybe don't divulge too much
            information about it, but what was your favourite problem-solving experience?
        </p>
        <h3>07:22</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Well, I mean there, there was one case. In the pricing engine in the PBS. While I was making a change,
            I found that there was a potential issue with the pricing, so there was a bug in there that was, I think,
            getting the price incorrect by, I think, it was like a factor of 10 or something, so it was pretty far off.
            If some logic was triggered. So, going through the process of proving that that was a bug, finding it,
            proving that it was occurring, and fixing it was satisfying.
        </p>
        <h3>08:12</h3>
        <p>
            Clyde: Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the I.T.
            industry?
        </p>
        <h3>08:24</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Ah, yeah, too sure about that one, to be honest.
        </p>
        <h3>08:57</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: So I received an e-mail asking me what a certain button did on an application, and so I provided the
            answer, but that caused another question to be asked, and that indicated to me that I hadn't really
            understood why they asked that question because you'll get things like that, where users will ask you
            something, but it's not really the root of what they're asking if that makes sense. So, if you answer that
            question, it's not really fixing the problem that they have. So yeah, I'm so I clarified that and figured
            out what they wanted and then gave that to them. So, I think that's pretty fundamental in I.T. Going back to
            figuring out what the important question is to answer and then answering it or important problem is to fix
            and then fixing that. So that can require, I guess, analysis, asking questions about what they want in order
            to get them the best result, and I think that's pretty much I.T. wide because, particularly with software
            development, it's always a discovery process, so it's a learning process.
        </p>
        <h3>10:17</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: So, it gets better and better as people ask questions, and you solve these questions, it gets
            improved.
        </p>
        <h3>10:20</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Yep.
        </p>
        <h3>10:27</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Cool. That's awesome. I know Clyde has asked the final question, but I thought maybe you could give
            us, students, some sort of advice or words of wisdom, as they say.
        </p>
        <h3>10:51</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: Umm. I think that working in I.T. can be really overwhelming, particularly when you're starting. It's
            easy to get discouraged, but I think it helps to remember that I'm pretty sure everyone feels like that,
            even if they don't admit it. Uh, so Yep. Just persevere. And it's OK to feel overwhelmed. Sometimes it's OK
            to ask for help.
        </p>
        <h3>11:19</h3>
        <p>
            Kamille: Awesome. Thank you so much for agreeing to be interviewed and taking some time off your lunch break
            for this call. Thank you, we really appreciate it.
        </p>
        <h3>11:31</h3>
        <p>
            Clyde: Thank you, Greg.
        </p>
        <h3>11:33</h3>
        <p>
            Greg: No worries, yeah, my pleasure.
