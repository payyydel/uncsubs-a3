            <h1>Joshua Peddell</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Joshua or Josh. I don't really have a preference. My 
                student ID is “S3858788”. I’m 22 years old, and like a few of my 
                fellow “Up and Coming” or UNC teammates, I have Filipino and Australian 
                heritage. I was born and raised on the Northern Beaches of Sydney. I am 
                the eldest of 3 to 2 cheeky parents, and I have two gorgeous dogs. I've 
                always had a very active interest in coding, and I am in love with the 
                progression of technology and its potential for humanity. I'm interested 
                in the field of Cyber Security or some variance of development, but I 
                haven't quite narrowed that down yet. Outside the course criteria, my 
                interests include films, music, comics, and video games. Specifically, 
                I really enjoy watching and dissecting all manner of films. Some of my 
                all-time favourite directors are Wes Anderson, Edgar Wright, Zac Snyder, 
                Steven Spielberg, and Quentin Tarantino. I love varying comic and 
                graphic novel types; however, my favourite "genre", as it is, is 
                superheroes. 
            </p>

            <h1>Kamille Acton</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Kamille Phoebe Enriquez Acton, student number “S3974098”. 
                I was born and raised in the Philippines; in 2020, I moved to 
                Australia to live and start a family with my partner. I went to 
                college and studied for a Bachelor of Arts in English in 2009. Later, 
                I took a Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication and graduated in 2013. 
                I have not done any other formal education until I enrolled in this 
                course. While I was at University, I fell in love with videography. I 
                found filming itself was the most memorable part as it felt more like 
                hanging out with my friends rather than doing coursework. I still shoot 
                short videos here and there to show my friends and family all the 
                exciting things I experience upon moving to Australia.

            <p>
                My name's Omar Dalati, student number “S3892747”, and I am 21 
                years old. I was born in Australia. However, my parents were 
                born in Lebanon, Beirut (Unfortunately, my Arabic is quite 
                broken). I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology, 
                which I completed at Chisholm Institute in 2019, and the amount 
                of knowledge I gained during my time there was incredible. 
                Unfortunately, it is 2022, and I've forgotten most of it, but I 
                hope this course jogs my memory. And I also had previously 
                studied with Swinburne University for a Bachelor of ICT, however, 
                I stopped my studies from working full time, so I only roughly 
                completed a year's worth of university. My hobbies include video 
                games, League of Legends and World of Warcraft, and the occasional 
                single-player game and watching anime/reading manga!

                My name is Harrison Groarke my student number is “S3972522”. I 
                was born in Australia, and I am 25 years old. I became interested 
                in IT when I was studying it in my senior years of high school; 
                with technology rapidly evolving, I’m excited to see what new 
                technologies will be available and see if it changes how we live 
                our lives in the next 15-20 years. I decided to pursue IT because I 
                wanted a change in my life, so I decided to sign up to RMIT’s 
                university Bachelor of IT degree using OUA. My hobbies include watching 
                movies, tv, anime and manga. I’m currently playing a lot of Fortnite in 
                my spare time because of the new no-build mode and patiently waiting for 
                Avatar 2 to release.

                which resulted in expanding my knowledge from the ground up.
