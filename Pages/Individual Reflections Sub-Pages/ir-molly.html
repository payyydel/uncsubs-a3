        <h1>Individual Reflection – Molly Murray</h1>
        <p>
            I think the group project went very well overall, I think our organisation skills were very effective in
            allowing us to complete the assignment in thorough detail. I also found the experience of working with this
            group to be very positive with supportive and helpful team members who were friendly and hardworking. I
            think it can sometimes be difficult to work in a group remotely where everyone has a different busy schedule
            and can’t always respond to each other however I think our group handled this as best as we could. Another
            thing I think our group could have improved on would be time management as I think the lack of specific
            deadlines led to some miscommunication.
        </p>

            One thing I found surprising was the sense of community it gave me as I’ve only ever done uni online which
            can be very isolating at times. I have learned that when doing group work sometimes it is best to allocate
            an equal amount of work to everyone at the start rather than work together on parts when you may work at a
            different pace or in different styles.
