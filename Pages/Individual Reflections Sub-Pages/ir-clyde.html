        <h2>What went well?</h2>
        <p>
            Getting started on the assignment was easy because everyone volunteered to take up a section of the
            assignment. This resulted in good collaboration completing the tasks and caused no one to sit around and do
            nothing. To add on, our weekly calls were very productive and allowed us to raise any concerns and build
            chemistry with each other.
        </p>
        <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
        <p>
            Communication was decent with most members but could've been improved by others. We did end up running into
            a minor issue due to lack of communication and transparency. However, this could have been mitigated if the
            group maintained weekly checkups on individual work just so others could help when needed.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
        <p>
            The one thing I found surprising was how much I dreaded using Microsoft Teams. Personally, I believe that
            Microsoft Teams is a confusing application to use and the group would’ve been better off using a combination
            of discord and google apps.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
        <p>
            One thing I learnt about groups is that working with members on a call besides the meetings helps quite a
            lot in terms of productivity and chemistry. I found that I was closer with those who were joining group
            calls and I was still productive in a study session involving others even though I like working by myself.
