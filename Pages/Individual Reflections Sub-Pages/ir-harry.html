        <h1>Individual Reflection â€“ Harrison Groarke</h1>
        <h2>What went well?</h2>
        <p>
            Being able to ask the team members for help and them offering help if I needed it as one of my problem
            points for Assessment 1 was not being to explain my information properly and thoroughly, they happily helped
            almost instantly, and I was happy to know how easy it was to ask for and receive help.
        </p>
        <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
        <p>
            Communication between the group left some things to be desired as everyone is busy with their own lives and
            schedules making it hard at different points during the task to get communication between group members.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
        <p>
            How nice and supportive team members were to each other, working in a supportive and collaborative
            environment makes working in the group a lot more enjoyable, during the group meetings no matter where we
            were we were always able to make time out of our busy schedule to be at the meetings, come rain or shine.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
        <p>
            One thing I have learned about groups is how working with supportive team members can really boast morale
            and make working with a group much more enjoyable, I also learned that time management is crucial to the
            success of a team.
