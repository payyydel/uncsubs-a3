        <h1>Individual Reflection – Kamille Acton</h1>
        <h2>What went well?</h2>
        <p>
            Our group is a mix of talented individuals, we had different personalities and different working
            experiences. I think we were able to work together professionally despite that. We got along well and
            everyone was willing to do their part as best as they could.
        </p>
        <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
        <p>
            As we were in different locations and have different day-to-day commitments, it was difficult to get
            everyone to respond to our chats. Each of us also has different distractions that prevent us from making it
            to a deadline that we, ourselves, set during team discussions. 
        </p>
        <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
        <p>
            I didn’t I would be good friends with my group mates. I always felt like I would be out of place because I
            don’t know much about the technicalities. However, they showed me that we were all there to learn and grow.
            They were also there to encourage me to do my best in my contribution and that they will help me improve
            them.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
        <p>
            I learned that I could push myself to come out of my shell and connect with strangers to achieve a goal. It
            was surprising that we all worked really well with each other.
