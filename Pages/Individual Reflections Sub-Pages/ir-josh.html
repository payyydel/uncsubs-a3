        <h1>Individual Reflection – Joshua Peddell</h1>
        <h2>What went well?</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, collaboration and organisational efforts were terrific. Everyone was really receptive and ready to
            get involved. Everyone was really open about their interests, and perceived strengths from the word go, and
            tasks were volunteered for with ease and next to zero clashing.
        </p>
        <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
        <p>
            An area that left a lot to be desired was communication for specific sections. Understandably we all have
            different responsibilities in our day-to-day lives; however, the load of transparency and communication
            energies wasn’t terribly well-balanced across all members.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one thing that was surprising</h2>
        <p>
            What was most surprising about the collaborative experience was the familiarity that we all adopted with one
            another. Without a second of doubt, acceptance was given and equally received. The most astounding part
            about this is the forum. We’re all situated at different corners of the continent, and yet.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one thing you have learned about groups</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone deserves a little bit of grace. However, it’s naïve to assume that a person won’t take a mile when
            you give them an inch. Inevitably, the drowning man always takes someone down with them. In this instance,
            too much grace can indirectly affect everyone.
