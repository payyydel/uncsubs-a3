        <h1>Individual Reflection – Omar Dalati</h1>
        <h2>What went well?</h2>
        <p>
            Within our group, what I felt went quite well was the professionalism among the team members and everyone
            playing a part within the team. Everyone was willing to work together, and nobody refused to play their
            part.
        </p>
        <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
        <p>
            Communication was the biggest thing that could have been improved, with tasks being asked and having them
            not met within the deadlines making it difficult to finish tasks within the timeframe we needed.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one surprising thing</h2>
        <p>
            How well we worked as a team was quite surprising, not in the professional aspect but how friendly everyone
            was together. Having a laugh while finishing the required work was quite nice compared to having a strict
            environment.
        </p>
        <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about</h2>
        <p>
            I am not someone who works well within a team environment, especially someone who is quite introverted as
            well. However, I decided to take the initiative to be the ‘lead’ on organising the Microsoft Teams chat, the
            scheduled meetings, and setting topics for each other. I enjoyed the responsibility aspect of leading a
            group to finish our first assignment together, and I’m looking forward to our second assignment and our
            presentation.
