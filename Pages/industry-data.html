            The burning glass data shows that Software Engineer is the strongest in demand within our group’s ideal jobs
            in all states. Coming in second is ICT Security Specialist (Technical Cyber Security Analyst), which has a
            solid future demand in all states. ICT Customer Support (I.T Support Officer) has no future demand for the
            position. However, it has a strong future demand in New South Wales. Lastly, Security Consultant has no
            future demand in all states.

            The correlation between the Burning glass data is still connected to each other due to the fact
            of the job listings from March 24th – 2017 to March 23rd – 2018.

            This information is a clear indication of future job demands. However, the data was from 2017,

        <h1>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h1>
        <p>
            Using the information above, the jobs of Software Engineer, ICT Security Specialist and Security consultant
            share very similar IT skills as they are required to have experience in using programming languages that
            employers need you to know the syntax within that programming language. On the other hand, the skills
            necessary for an ICT Customer Support Officer mainly consist of technical support to ensure hardware and
            software systems are running efficiently for users. To be able to remotely support users via remote desktop
            software, this will ensure that users can have the utmost support from the support officers.
        </p>

        <h1>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h1>
        <p>
            Regarding the general skills, they are all very similar to each other’s position since they all fall under
            the IT field. All four jobs require the top 5 general skills: communication skills, problem-solving,
            organisational skills, writing and collaboration. Overall, it shows that the chosen jobs have essential
            general skills that employers highly demand.
        </p>

        <h1>What are the three highest-ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h1>
        <p>
            The top three highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not within the required skill set of all jobs are,
            Business Analysts, Graphic Design and Business Management. This is because these skills are not relevant to
            any of the job positions within our group.
        </p>

        <h1>What are the three highest-ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h1>
        <p>
            The three highest-ranked general skills that aren’t within the required skill set are creativity,
            leadership, and mentoring. The specific reason these aren’t within the required skill set of our ideal jobs
            within our group is considering the similarities between every job, and general skills within a professional
            environment don’t drastically change from job to job. In comparison to how IT-specific skills change from
            job to job, the requirement for a software engineer to an IT Support Officer is quite different

        <h1>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Clyde</b> – After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion of my ideal job has changed. However, it
            wasn’t because of the data but rather my interests changing during the semester. The thought of pursuing a
            long career to become a Software Engineer doesn’t align with my interests, and I would rather work in the
            cybersecurity field.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Omar</b> – After reading the burning glass data, my ideal job has been influenced by the data however I
            am still currently on the fence since I do genuinely want to have an opportunity with my ideal job as the
            burning glass data stated that my position is not a job that is in demand within my state in Victoria. New
            South Wales is the only state that has a strong future demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Harrison</b> – After reading through burning glass, I have decided that I would like to change from being
            a security consultant to becoming a software engineer, as they are more in demand. You will be able to get a
            job easier than a security consultant as a software engineer, but it pays better and allows you to work not
            just in Australia but also overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Joshua</b> – Upon looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. However,
            after doing my I.T. Tech section, my area of interest has narrowed down a bit to the field of Machine
            Learning / Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, Cyber Security has begun to pique my interest throughout
            the study period.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Kamille</b> – Upon looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. If
            anything, the module and research I have done on the development of Cloud Computing in the next couple of
            years only made me pursue this career more. Although I still like the challenge and creativity in UI/UX
            design, I'm focusing most of my attention towards Security.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Molly</b> - Upon looking at the burning glass data, my opinion on my ideal job hasn’t changed all that
            much. In fact, the research I have done concerning Artificial Intelligence has only confirmed my feelings on
            the matter. Although, throughout the study period and my research on Crypto during the assignment, I am now
            just as interested in pursuing a job in the fintech industry.
