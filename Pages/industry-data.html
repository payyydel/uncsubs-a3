                Using the information above, the jobs of Software Engineer, ICT Security Specialist and Security
                consultant
                share very similar IT skills as they are required to have experience in using programming languages that
                employers need you to know the syntax within that programming language. On the other hand, the skills
                necessary for an ICT Customer Support Officer mainly consist of technical support to ensure hardware and
                software systems are running efficiently for users. To be able to remotely support users via remote
                desktop
                software, this will ensure that users can have the utmost support from the support officers.

            <h1>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h1>
            <p>
                Regarding the general skills, they are all very similar to each other’s position since they all fall
                under
                the IT field. All four jobs require the top 5 general skills: communication skills, problem-solving,
                organisational skills, writing and collaboration. Overall, it shows that the chosen jobs have essential
                general skills that employers highly demand.

                The top three highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not within the required skill set of all jobs
                are,
                Business Analysts, Graphic Design and Business Management. This is because these skills are not relevant

            <h1>What are the three highest-ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h1>
            <p>
                The three highest-ranked general skills that aren’t within the required skill set are creativity,
                leadership, and mentoring. The specific reason these aren’t within the required skill set of our ideal
                jobs
                within our group is considering the similarities between every job, and general skills within a
                professional
                environment don’t drastically change from job to job. In comparison to how IT-specific skills change
                from
                job to job, the requirement for a software engineer to an IT Support Officer is quite different

                analyst, you must also be able to adapt quickly to new threats and different types of technologies;
                however,
                you must also be able to identify and manage risks. Good research skills and conceptual understanding of
                systems and networks will help a cyber security analyst stay up to date with current challenges and be
                able
                to respond promptly to threats or interruptions.

            <h1>Software Engineer</h1>
            <p>
                A Software engineer applies engineering principles and programming language, and systems knowledge to
                build
                software solutions for users. They often oversee and manage all aspects of a project from beginning to
                end.
                This branch of computer science deals with software design, development, maintenance, testing, and
                application. Various roles within the broader software engineering category include front-end or
                back-end
                engineers, full-stack engineers, quality assurance engineers, security engineers, and mobile app
                developers.
            </p>

            <h1>Top-general skills</h1>
            <p>
                One of the most important general software engineering skills is communication. It involves the ability
                to
                give and receive feedback with clarity and understanding. Good communication skills also allow engineers
                to
                collaborate effectively with colleagues and clients. Working well in a team is another important general
                skill for a software engineer. The ability to work collaboratively and leverage years of software
                engineering experience help software companies grow and achieve results. Another essential skill for
                software engineers is problem-solving. Strong problem-solving skills involve combining creative and
                analytical thinking, breaking down the question into smaller parts, and applying it to a problem using a
                systematic approach.

                Computer programming and coding, software development, and object-orientated design are the most
                important
                IT skills relevant to becoming a software engineer. Which includes proficiency in programming languages
                such
                as Python, Java, C, C++, or Scala. Some engineers may focus on database development and algorithms,
                while
                others might specialise in testing procedures. Other IT skills involve experience with platforms to
                share
                and develop code, such as GitHub, and bug-checking software, such as Jira.

            <h1>Security Consultant</h1>
            <p>
                A security consultant is tasked with protecting a client's data from being breached while also
                identifying
                problems in the business's software. A security consultant or analyst pinpoints vulnerabilities in
                computer
                systems, networks, and software programs and works closely with clients and organisations to develop
                strategic approaches to strengthen and future-proof IT systems. Which may involve regular security
                audits
                and assessments of an organisation's hardware, network, and software systems. A security consultant is
                often
                engaged as an independent expert to review and provide advice and strategy for IT security.
            </p>

            <h1>Top-general skills</h1>
            <p>
                Important general skills for being a security consultant include strong problem-solving skills, having
                the
                ability to define a problem, and using analytical thinking to find creative ways to solve it. Strong
                communication and interpersonal skills are needed to liaise with clients to understand how their systems
                work and identify specific vulnerabilities or risks. Other general skills include risk assessment and
                management, incident and report writing, and understanding cybersecurity's key concepts and language.
                This
                role requires strong analytical skills, collaboration, teamwork, and attention to detail.
            </p>

            <h1>IT-specific skills</h1>
            <p>
                The IT-specific skills required for a security consultant are a strong understanding of a range of
                hardware
                networks and software systems with the ability to test and problem-solve in these various systems. A
                security consultant must know the current standards and regulations for IT systems, pinpoint
                vulnerabilities
                in computer systems, networks, and software programs, and identify strategies to mitigate risk and
                overcome
                these vulnerabilities. It may involve setting up and implementing user access controls and access
                management
                systems, monitoring network and application performance, identifying irregular activity, and performing
                audits to ensure security practices are compliant. Sometimes, it might involve deploying endpoint
                detection
                and prevention tools to prevent hacking and malicious attacks. Knowledge of encryption technologies and
                procedures for handling security incidents is also important.

            <h1>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
            </h1>
            <p>
                <b>Clyde</b> – After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion of my ideal job has changed. However,
                it
                wasn’t because of the data but rather my interests changing during the semester. The thought of pursuing
                a
                long career to become a Software Engineer doesn’t align with my interests, and I would rather work in
                the
                cybersecurity field.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Omar</b> – After reading the burning glass data, my ideal job has been influenced by the data however
                I
                am still currently on the fence since I do genuinely want to have an opportunity with my ideal job as
                the
                burning glass data stated that my position is not a job that is in demand within my state in Victoria.
                New
                South Wales is the only state that has a strong future demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Harrison</b> – After reading through burning glass, I have decided that I would like to change from
                being
                a security consultant to becoming a software engineer, as they are more in demand. You will be able to
                get a
                job easier than a security consultant as a software engineer, but it pays better and allows you to work
                not
                just in Australia but also overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Joshua</b> – Upon looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed.
                However,
                after doing my I.T. Tech section, my area of interest has narrowed down a bit to the field of Machine
                Learning / Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, Cyber Security has begun to pique my interest
                throughout
                the study period.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Kamille</b> – Upon looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. If
                anything, the module and research I have done on the development of Cloud Computing in the next couple
                of
                years only made me pursue this career more. Although I still like the challenge and creativity in UI/UX
                design, I'm focusing most of my attention towards Security.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Molly</b> - Upon looking at the burning glass data, my opinion on my ideal job hasn’t changed all
                that
                much. In fact, the research I have done concerning Artificial Intelligence has only confirmed my
                feelings on
                the matter. Although, throughout the study period and my research on Crypto during the assignment, I am
                now
                just as interested in pursuing a job in the fintech industry.
