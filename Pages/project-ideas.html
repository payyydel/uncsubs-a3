        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Our team "project idea" will be the creation of an application/website where consumers can pay for their
            subscription services, such as Netflix, Amazon, Spotify etc., on a centralised platform so that it reflects
            as a single payment rather than multiple. All subscriptions will charge via the service as per their regular
            billing date, culminating in a single charge from a chosen bank account or credit/debit card. Simply choose
            the subscription service you desire, then add it to your account to be billed each month, and you can choose
            any service as you please. You will be able to manage all your subscriptions in one place. You'll be able to
            access the platform on any iOS and Android devices. And also any web browser (excluding internet explorer)

        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>
            We, collectively as a group, had to decide what project idea we would choose, in which we had to discuss
            whose idea would be taking the lead in becoming a project idea for the group Up & Coming. After careful
            consideration, we decided to go with Omar's Project Idea. We, as a group, had taken this decision because of
            how relatable the concept is to everyone's daily life. Everyone mentioned how beneficial this service is.
            Being able to manage all payments throughout one single pay period with an app/website is convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our entire motivation behind this particular "project idea" is that we do not appreciate having
            subscriptions
            withdrawn out of our personal bank accounts at different dates each month. The continuous build-up of
            separate, difficult-to-track charges makes budgeting significantly more complex than necessary. It isn't
            enjoyable, to say the least! We want to create a service where all your subscriptions are captured within
            one payment at your billing date. It will ensure that you'll no longer have to encounter separate charges
            and do wonders organisationally, allowing for more effective budgeting.
        </p>

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            Our product/service is a centralised subscription hub where you can freely add any of the
            subscriptions you use, ranging from Netflix, Amazon, Crunchyroll, Stan, Disney+, Spotify and
            beyond. Speaking of, see how we are just listing and listing all these subscription-based services?
            It's already getting quite annoying. We just listed six subscription services, all of which have
            separate monthly charges, meaning you are being billed six different times every month. And those
            are just the ones we've listed. Think back to how you'd see that notification go off on your phone.
            It gets annoying to track and manage.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what if you decided to stop using one of those services? Then you find yourself having to
            embark on the trek that is successfully unsubscribing. You log onto the provider's website and
            unsubscribe, you log onto the provider's website and unsubscribe, you log onto the provider's
            website and unsubscribe! One by one. It's a nuisance even having to consider doing this, right?
            I mean, writing that was exhausting for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, our solution? We propose the creation of a single, centralised subscriptions hub where you
            can manage all your services, all from your phone. Our pioneering mediums being a mobile application,
            and an easily accessible website. We aim to partner and support whatever service you use with 110%
            effort. Now, it is a relatively straightforward system. After registering an account with a valid
            email address, you'll be asked to validate your banking details. Whether it's a direct debit or
            credit/debit card details is up to you, but we will need to check. Don't worry if you see a dollar
            or two come out. We'll put it right back, we promise! You will then be able to search for the service
            you use or want to use and subscribe. You'll be redirected to the service provider's relevant linking
            page, do the thing, and then meet us back at your services hub. Simple right? That's not even the best
            part. When initially subscribing to a service, if you do so in the middle of your monthly pay cycle,
            you will only be required to pay the remaining days on a pro-rata basis. Meaning you won't be paying
            anything extra, and you'll have your payments lined up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you'll be able to merge any existing accounts, as we don't want you missing out on any
            of your favourite shows or messing with your carefully curated algorithms. It will automatically connect
            once your payment has gone through, and you'll be prompted to link up your account with your chosen
            subscription service. Sadly, you won't be able to stream any services on our platform. We are exclusively
            a centralised subscription service management platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service will be designed to be intuitive and accessible. Hence the mobile smartphone platform. However,
            we want to ensure it is available to all. And so, with that in mind, we will also be launching on a nearly
            one-to-one, web browser-based version, with minor functional changes, which means that it will not only be
            familiar but convenient.

    <section class="projectidea-content">
        <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>
            To create the website, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and require a payment portal system or point of
            sale (P.O.S) that will directly work with all subscription services.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will require hardware to design and create our site to perform the subscription model. We'll need
            laptops/desktops (depending on who is programming the application). Off-site, dedicated servers to host,
            or contact a service provider to host.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the development of smartphone applications, we will be using Swift and Object C for iOS-based systems
            and Java for Android-based systems. Both applications will be the same, the only difference being the
            programming language. No device will have an advantage/disadvantage on the operating system that your
            device runs.
        </p>

    <section class="projectidea-content">
        <h1>Skills Required</h1>
        <p>
            The first and most essential skill required is the ability to create a mock-up design of how the app and
            website U.Is. To be used as a foundation. Therefore, development experiences/skills with Swift, Object C
            for iOS, and Java for Android are necessary. The website will need to be written up using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, with the hardware element being relatively tame. A laptop/desktop that can program without
            issues and a higher-end specification laptop will assist with programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have devised two methods for doing this. A team member can learn how to program through an app
            development course in the chosen coding languages. This venture can be undertaken via many different
            pathways,a couple being an RMIT-hosted online short course or various self-paced online coding courses,
            e.g.Codeacadamy, Khan Academy etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second option would require the hiring of developers to code both platforms. We would require
            front-end developers to create the base of our website and user interface designers to design both the
            application and website. Additionally, back-end developers to manage the server-to-user connection, the
            customer's login information, user encryption, and user security.

    <section class="projectidea-content">
        <h1>Drawbacks</h1>
        <p>
            The biggest drawback isn't the programming or the project's development but the subscription licensing.
            We would need to come to an agreement with companies to set up our subscription service. If we do not
            have enough services, the project will fail.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be ideal to create the service with the opportunity of a free monthly trial. But the free
            month is more so to attract customers to use our services. The results could vary, either good or bad.
            Although widely impractical, customers could opt to use the free trial initiative repeatedly through
            rotating pseudonym emails to avoid payment. We plan to counter this with any payment details that have
            your name, being securely stored in our database, as well as I.P-based counter-measures in an effort to
            limit any potential abuse of service.
        </p>

        <h1>Market</h1>
        <p>
            Our target audience will be the more time-constrained demographic who use subscription services. The
            reasoning behind this is based on the idea of convenience and ease of use, managing all your subscription
            payments directly through our centralised service. Users will have access to their subscriptions via both
            the web and smartphone applications. We will primarily target younger audiences, such as college/university
            students; however, families would also benefit from this service. The sentiment of time constraints extends
            to a family working five days a week with children.
        </p>
        <p>
            How would we promote our product service? We would create videos of our platform showcasing the benefits
            to our potential users. Because our target audience is, again, very time-constrained, we would have to
            attract their attention in less than 1 minute of them watching our videos on any advertised platform. As we
            are young adults ourselves, the utilisation of social media such as "Instagram", "TikTok", "YouTube",
            "Twitter" and "Facebook" etc. are the best means by which to reach our target audience, creating paid
            advertising
            throughout these platforms. This is the most effective way to reach our audience regarding our service
            product.

        <h1> Next Phase / Update</h1>
        <p>
            What will the next phase/update of our project idea include? Essentially what we would desire to be able to
            implement is the ability to use machine learning to gather the data of our users and what it is they're
            currently watching. And to implement this information for better recommendations to our users. We are
            interested in implementing our subscription goodie boxes! The data gathered from our system would allow our
            customers to subscribe to our monthly goodie boxes, which vary from Japanese candy care packages, dog goodie
            boxes, beauty/healthcare boxes, etc. It will create a more diverse platform, not specifically only creating
            subscriptions to other services.

        <h1>Outcome</h1>
        <p>
            What is the outcome of our project idea? If the project is successful, consumers will have access to a
            centralised subscription service and payment application across desktop and smartphone platforms. Ultimately
            people will no longer have numerous payments from their bank accounts. Each month it will reflect as a
            singular invoice, reflecting their cost within bank statements/credit cards. Customers that use our service
            will no longer have to worry about what time each subscription service is taken out of singularly, as now
            all subscription services that you have currently through our platform will receive one bill. The service
            allows our customers to manage all their subscriptions without chasing and managing what payments are coming
            out every month.
