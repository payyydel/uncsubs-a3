        <h1>Project Idea - Up and Coming" (U.N.C)</h1>
    </section>
    <div class="projectidea">
      
        <p><b>Overview:</b>
            Our team project idea is that we wish to create an app/website where you'll pay for your subscription services,
            such as Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify. Directly through my service carrier so that it reflects as one
            payment, not multiple payments, and all charges are aligned on the same day. Choose the subscription
            service you desire and add it to your account to be billed each month, and you can choose any service as
            you please. You will be able to manage all your subscriptions in one place.
        </p>
        <p><b>Motivation:</b> We are motivated by this project idea because I don't particularly appreciate having my
            subscriptions taken out every month at different times, and they are all separate invoices. So, we see
            this continuous build-up with services being charged monthly on bank statements. It isn't enjoyable! I
            want to create a service where all your subscriptions are captured within one payment at your billing
            date. It will ensure that you'll no longer have to encounter any more separate charges. </p>
        <p><b>Description: </b> Our product/service is a subscription service where you can freely choose to add any
            of
            the subscriptions you use, whether that varies from having Netflix, Amazon, Crunchyroll, Stan, Disney+,
            or Spotify. See how we are just listing and listing all these subscription-based services, and it's already
            getting quite annoying; We have just listed six services, which all have separate monthly charges and which
            get billed onto your bank account five times every month. You see that notification pop off on your
            phone. It gets annoying to manage, and what if you stop using one of those services? You'll log onto the
            provider's website and unsubscribe separately, one by one. Is it a nuisance to even consider having to
            do this right? So, what it is, We will create a service where you can manage all your subscriptions
            directly through your phone through our app and or our website. We will support whatever you use to the
            best of our ability. It is quite a straightforward system; you'll be able to search for the product you want
            to subscribe to, and you will receive an invoice for your payments. </p>

        <p>
            If you subscribe mid-month of your monthly cycle what will happen is, you'll be able to see how many
            days to go until your payment date. You'll only be required to pay the days counting to you when payment
            is required. So, you will not be paying anything extra for your bill, and then you'll have your payments
            lined up.

        </p>
        <p>This service will be straightforward and accessible. Still, on a web browser which is a one-to-one copy,
            there are no differences or disadvantages to using the web browser. Using it on your phone is easier,
            but we want to ensure it is accessible to all!

            You'll be able to merge your existing accounts as we don't want you missing on your saved shows, it will
            automatically connect once your payment has gone through, and you'll be prompted to link up your account
            with your chosen subscription service!
            You won't be able to watch any services on our platform. The reasoning is that we are purely a
            subscription service for you to use the services, but all payments are directed through us.
        </p>
        </p>

        <p><b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Tools and Technologies:
            For us to create the website, we would need to have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and as well as require a
            payment portal system that will directly work with all subscription services.

            To perform the subscription model, we would need hardware to create our website, so we would need
            laptops/desktops (depending on who is programming the application). We would need to host our servers or
            contact a service provider to host our websites to have users connect to the website.
        <p>
            To create our application to use on iOS and Android devices, we would
            have our app programmed within Swift and Object C, and for Android, we will be
            using Java. Both applications will be the same only difference being the
            programming language. No device will have an advantage/disadvantage on the
            operating system that your device runs.
        </p>
        </p>

        <p><b>Skills Required: </b>
            The first skill that is required and the most essential skill to create my project idea is to create a
            mock-up of the design how the app and website will look like. Then we would implement

            The skills required for the project are being able to develop an app. Coding with using Swift, Object C
            for iOS, and Java for Android. The website will need to be written up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Hardware won't be over the top. We will just need to have a laptop/desktop that can program with no
            issues, and a higher-end specification laptop will assist with programming.

        <p> I can take this within two options I can learn how to program myself through an app development course
            as the programming language that I have chosen is Object C and Swift for iOS and Java for Android. I can
            study these programming languages via RMIT Online, it is a short course.

            The second option with my project idea requires for myself to hire developers to code both the software
            and web browser version of both products. Front-end Developers to create the base of our website, we
            require a User Interface Designers to design both the application and website. And a back-end Developers
            to manage the server to user connection, the customers log in information, user encryption, user
            security.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p><b>Drawbacks: </b>The biggest drawback isn't the programming or the development of the project, but it is the
            licensing of said subscriptions, we would need to come into agreement with companies to set up our
            subscription service. If we do not have enough services, the project idea will fail.

            We wish to create the service to have the ability of having a free monthly trial on us. The reason this could
            go good or bad is because customers just could essentially use the one month and then stop using our
            service, so they aren't required to pay to use the service again. How we plan on countering this by any
            payment details that have your name, will have your name stored within our system, so that this cannot be
            abused whatsoever. But the free month is more so to attract customers to use our services.
        </p>
        <p><b>Market: </b>
            So, our target audience will be to the demographic that is very time constraint which use subscription
            services. These are our main target audience as you'll be easily able to manage all your subscription
            payments directly through our service. This is very easy for people to manage their payments! They can see
            it through the app and or on our website, it is very convenient for people to use if they are always time
            constraint. This would be directed to the younger audiences such as college / university students, however
            also families would benefit from this service also. This is because if a family is working 5 days a week and
            have kids, having to manage it is the same concept as I stated earlier.
            <br>
            How would we promote our product service? As we are young adults ourselves, social media such as Instagram,
            TikTok, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are the best away to reach our target audience, creating paid
            advertising throughout these platforms. We would be able to create videos of our product to be able to show
            our customers what our product Is about, and because our target audience is very time constraint, we would
            have to gather their attention in less than 1 minute of them watching out videos on any advertised platform,
            this is the best and most effective way to reach to our audience regarding our service product.

        </p>

        <p><b>Outcome: </b>
            If the project is successful, consumers can use our subscription service and manage their services
            directly through our application. The original problem is resolved. The development is that people do
            not have numerous payments from their bank accounts. It will be shown as one single invoice.
