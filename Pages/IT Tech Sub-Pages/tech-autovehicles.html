        <h3>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now?</h3>
        <p>
            Autonomous vehicles have always been highly associated with "the future" since the 90s, but most
            automotive companies' software still has a long road ahead. Fully autonomous vehicles refer to a
            vehicle capable of sensing and adapting to the environment around them to safely reach a destination
            or complete a task with no human input. This is achieved through a variety of tested software and
            hardware that are incorporated within and throughout the vehicle so it can process all the
            information necessary and act accordingly. Acknowledging that the technology of autonomous vehicles
            is vast, I will focus on the aspect of driverless cars. Autonomous cars are categorised by levels 0
            to 5, created by The Society of Automotive Engineers and adopted by the U.S Department of
            Transportation. Level 0 refers to vehicles that require to be manually controlled by a human, while
            level 5 refers to fully self-driving cars that require no human interference (synopsys.com).
            Currently, the majority of autonomous vehicles are considered to be on level 2, with a handful on
            level 3. Level 2 is known as "advanced driver assistance systems", which allow the vehicle to
            control the speed and direction, but a driver is still necessary and can take control anytime. On
            the other hand, level 3 technology is more advanced as the vehicle can perform a task based on its
            surroundings, such as overtaking a slow car (synopsys.com).
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h3>
        <p>
            Looking at Elon Musk's tweet, "... Generalised self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires a
            large
            part of real-world AI. Didn't expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect",
            goes to show that many automotive companies have underestimated the task in delivering a fully
            autonomous vehicle to consumers. Critics from ABI Research predict that in 2025, 8 million vehicles
            will be launched with SAE level 3, 4 and 5 technology to consumers (2018, abiresearch.com). However,
            since the development towards level 5 autonomous vehicles has been slower than expected, and
            legislation has been struggling to keep up, it is fair to say that in the next three years, there
            will be an increase in vehicles being classified as level 3 and a few at level 4. Level 4 refers to
            vehicles having the capability to drive safely and take control at an advanced level, requiring
            minimal human interference for certain circumstances. However, humans still have the option to take
            control of the wheel, and the car can only be driven in a limited area (synopsys.com). Overall,
            there will definitely be more advancements in overcoming challenges such as weather, traffic, and
            road conditions and improvements in the software and hardware used in the technology of AVs.

        <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
        <p>
            All automotive companies have their own process, but this state-of-the-art technology is
            possible through the combination of software, hardware and artificial intelligence. Each car is
            fitted with numerous sensors throughout the vehicle's perimeter that can either be light detection and
            ranging or radar. Light detection and ranging sensors emit infrared laser that bounces off an object and
            returns, whilst radar sensors use radio waves. This process of implementing sensors allows the
            central computer within the vehicle to create a detailed profile of the size, shape and position
            of objects or surroundings based on the data received (Sajan Saini, Ted-Ed). Cameras are also used
            throughout the vehicle to read signs and traffic lights and detect road lanes and the
            surroundings, which are then relayed back to the central computer. Ai is used by companies such as Tesla,
            which allows the machine to learn as data from individual vehicles reports back to the headquarters.
            This data then allows the machine to create algorithms and predict possibilities based on previous
            data, which results in improvements in the car.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change?</h3>
        <p>
            As more consumers demand autonomous vehicles, our environment will likely adapt to this new
            technology. The first significant impact would be the new laws and legislations created by the
            government to support and adapt to autonomous vehicles sharing the roads with us. Infrastructure
            around and on the roads would be equipped with sensors, 5g networks, roadside computers and more
            to
            accommodate autonomous vehicles and allow for data to be shared. With more autonomous cars on
            the
            roads, we could expect a downtrend in car accidents due to less human error and better traffic
            flow
            as vehicles drive in unison. Lastly, it would be interesting to see if car insurance will be the
            driver's or the automaker's responsibility as the car will be operating by itself.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
        <p>
            I believe that everyone would be affected by fully autonomous vehicles in either a positive or
            negative way. With driverless cars, partygoers will encounter less hassle and cost of getting to
            their destinations safely, the elderly and disabled get to travel alone safely, and children may
            even be able to travel in a vehicle without a qualified driver. Assuming companies like Uber
            implement driverless cars into their fleet, frequent users of the service would be delighted as
            the
            cost of each ride would dramatically decrease and enable 24/7 services. However, the majority of
            people working in the transportation mobility industry will lose their jobs to these robots.
            Furthermore, as more people decide not to drive themselves, their driving capabilities will
            likely
            deteriorate over time.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned, when transportation companies put autonomous cars into effect, drivers within that
            industry will no longer be needed since it incentivises companies to cut wages out of their
            operating costs. On the other hand, the rise of autonomous vehicles can create an increase in
            jobs within the automotive industry, but it will most likely be in countries like China.
            Overall, the development of this technology will keep improving over time as companies compete
            with each other.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>How will this affect you in your daily life?</h3>
        <p>
            I believe that autonomous vehicles would have a minimal effect on my everyday life. This is
            because I prefer driving the car myself and having the ability to modify the vehicle to my
            liking. Despite autonomous cars not being my first preference, I wouldn't consider not buying
            one as I am intrigued by this futuristic technology. Lastly, it would be interesting to see if
            new laws and legislation created for autonomous vehicles would have an impact on drivers.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
        <p>
            The most visible change would be the government implementing more cameras on the roadside,
            modifying buildings and adding technology around the roads to support driverless vehicles.
            Additionally, seeing people watching a movie, reading a book or doing anything other than
            driving in the front seat would catch me off guard. Hopefully, as more autonomous vehicles share
            the roads with me, I could expect to encounter better traffic flow and fewer cars driving way
            below the speed limit.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>How will this affect members of your family or friends?</h3>
        <p>
            Driverless cars will provide an option of convenient transport for my family members and friends
            who choose to use a service or purchase a vehicle. Those who end up using autonomous cars will
            have the luxury of using the time spent driving to get work done during a busy commute home or
            anything else they wish to do. For my friends who rely on public transport or transportation
            apps, it means lower fare prices without the awkward presence of a stranger. Furthermore, this
            technology will benefit my grandparents as it provides a safer alternative to travel when they
            become incapable of driving on the roads.
