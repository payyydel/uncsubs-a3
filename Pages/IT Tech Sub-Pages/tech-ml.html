        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <h2>Joshua Peddell</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>
            “Machine Learning” (ML) is a branch of “Artificial Intelligence” (AI). To understand ML, you first must
            understand that AI's goal is to computationally imitate and mimic human thought processing speeds and
            intelligence. ML’s purpose, being a subset of AI, is for programs and machines to learn and adapt without
            the need for human input. Multifaceted algorithms are built into hardware and/or software with the purpose
            of recognising data and building predictions surrounding it. A more profound subset of ML, termed “Deep
            Learning” (DL), applies a more efficient artificial neural network method for processing large quantities of
            “unstructured” and “structured” data. Examples of unstructured data are natural language text, speech,
            images, and videos, whereas examples of structured data are names, credit card numbers, geolocation, and
            stock information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, ML is present in our everyday lives more than people probably realise. It has ushered a means for
            systems to enrich their knowledge base with larger data sets, allowing for fewer programming and logic
            errors across the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two key examples of this are image and speech recognition. The most recognisable uses of ML to date, image
            and speech recognition, have been adapted in the field of pattern recognition. A significant milestone in
            the overall pursuit of AI. Real-world applications include handwriting recognition, subject classification,
            voice search, dictation recognition, appliance control etc. Social media platforms such as Facebook use ML
            algorithms to compile your activity, likes, comments, friends, locational check-ins and more to create
            targeted advertisements, suggest friends and events, recommend group communities and more. Consumer-facing
            technology giants like Apple use their A-Series chips in their iPhones and M-Series chips in their iPads and
            Mac products to power their ML functions such as image and video object detection, language analysis, sound
            classification, and of course, their “smart” assistant Siri. Relentlessly adapting based on new data, ML
            continues to evolve. Relatively speaking, this technology is only in its infancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore prospectively, short-term progressions likely to be made will be the development and
            implementation of hyper-automation, the beginnings of a quantum leap in cyber security, and the evolutionary
            introduction of the “Metaverse”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hyper-automation is an enterprise-driven, methodical approach with the intent of automating as many business
            and IT-related processes as possible. Applying Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to lessen human dependency
            allows for increased accuracy, consistency and speed overall, effectively reducing any losses typically
            incurred by human error or oversight. A corporate surge in the employment of RPA technologies is imminent
            within the next three to five years and will predicatively reduce operational costs by up to 30%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cyber security industry is booming as of late. With the progression of technology comes increased
            vulnerability, and with a globally estimated cost of $6 trillion annually due to cybercrimes, businesses
            have already begun to explore AI/ML options to alleviate risks. Employing AI and ML-powered patterns and
            unusual activity recognition in an effort to not only automate but diminish risks. Thereby dissuading
            sceptical investors and restoring confidence in businesses. A unique advantage to AI/ML power cyber security
            is its ability to accumulate and adapt with precision and unparalleled speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally announced at Facebook, now Meta’s “Connect 2021” keynote event, the “Metaverse” is set to be a
            revolutionary step towards global connection, essentially evolving and absorbing the internet. Serving as a
            fundamental foundation for the venture, AI and ML will power this Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality
            (VR) platform. Aiding as a vital linking component of major technologies involved like 3D and VR animation,
            and automating and improving repetitive tasks, thus increasing efficiency across the entire platform.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>
            ML’s likely impact as we advance will be the implementation of it, as well as AI, across almost every facet
            of human existence. From enterprise to day-to-day, the application of ML will create opportunities by
            helping block out the white noise felt in everyday tasks, allowing for a more focused approach towards our
            evolution. Significant likely everyday impacts will be in the realms of education and smart home security.
        </p>
        <p>
            ML can provide a revolutionary approach to how we are educated going forward. With the implementation of
            "smart classrooms", systems would be able to record an individual’s performance in select areas and
            formulate a highly effective study plan designed around empowering students, cultivating their strengths, as
            well as a means by which to strengthen any necessary shortcomings required in either chosen career path or
            fundamental subjects. This would, in turn, ease the burden on educators and produce productive members of
            society. It would even aid in reducing mental health issues typically a result of a stagnated learning
            experience in early adolescence, improving people’s quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            ML power smart home security systems are becoming a part of the norm, providing peace of mind to homeowners
            and residents. Essential smart home security features include facial recognition, sound analysis, speech
            recognition, smoke detection and more. ML smart home security systems provide a level of automation and
            recognition that could mean the difference between losing your belongings due to a fire or a break-in and
            even life and death. It would allow for home and contents premiums to be reduced thanks to increased
            response times and reduced crime rates in residential suburbs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, ML is likely to affect a large number of the population. Increased efficiency and effectiveness on
            a global scale will make problem-solving a much less time-consuming endeavour. It will make way for an
            evolutionary quantum leap in technology. Though it would make a significant number of jobs redundant, it
            would open up a whole realm of employment opportunities, raising the bar moving forward for employment.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>
            In my everyday life, I use a number of different services, platforms, and hardware that all have some manner
            of ML to them. The aforementioned progression can undoubtedly improve an individual’s day-to-day quality of
            life. I foresee a progressive change in how I go about tasks, with most of the mundane ones being relatively
            automated. Increased efficiency and accuracy would aid in transport predictions and planning, work
            processes, and my home security and automation use, generally just allowing me to focus on what’s important.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will have a very positive impact on members of my family. In an ideal world, my kid brother would have
            the opportunity to study in a manner that feels intuitive and effortless. It would make university feel like
            less of a trial of impending adulthood and more like a standard of moral excellence to hold himself to, a
            place for him to be challenged in an inviting community. My mother would be able to visit her family
            overseas or attend important cultural events that she would otherwise be unable to participate in via some
            means of AR/VR. My father and other younger brother would be able to work in their chosen trades with ease
            and efficiency thanks to even the seemingly minuscule technological improvements in their relevant fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            ML is an all-encompassing technology, pioneering a path for all manners of technologies. However, I do have
            some reservations I’d be remiss not to mention. I am all for the progression of technology; however, I'm
            worried about the immediate impacts such a rapidly evolving technology would have upon noticeable,
            widespread impact. As for everyday life, the adjustment period will be rough and must be handled swiftly but
            delicately. As with most of the population, we’ll likely miss doing some things ourselves, with our hands,
            in a manner of speaking. But I do think these kinds of responses could lead to an equilibrium of sorts.
            Balancing technology and our humanity.
