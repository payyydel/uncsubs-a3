        <h1>Cloud</h1>
        <h2>Kamille Acton</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>
            The cloud describes infrastructure that stores data in remote servers that can be accessed through any
            device connected to the internet. In the 1960’s, an American computer scientist, J.C.R. Licklider,
            conceptualised a network that would allow anyone in the world to access a centralised computer. After years
            of development, Professor Ramnath Chellappa coined the term “cloud computing” during his talk on the “new
            computing paradigm” in 1997(1). Many technologies are now centralised and produced on a larger scale which
            offers a broader range of options beyond building or buying.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are now able to rent or subscribe to IT resources and expand rented capacity as needed. Businesses can
            expand their market from their local area to a global market. For an example, e-commerce websites can store
            large amounts of data from their products images, inventory data, pricing, and their customer’s account and
            shipping information. With the expansion of the company’s market comes increased traffic to their website
            which requires a huge processing system to be able to keep up with demand. They would also need software
            that tells the server exactly how to process the data. These IT solutions are now available to rent from
            multiple suppliers. Renting enables companies to integrate their website with other software to process
            payments and shipping and simultaneously marketing their products across multiple platforms without having
            to write the code from scratch or hiring a development team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and Instagram store user data such as
            images and reels, photo editing functions, and not to mention a huge amount of traffic flow. These platforms
            make use of the cloud to make sure that they have the capacity to keep up with enormous traffic fluctuations
            and a large number of media being uploaded to their servers.
        </p>

        <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other
            developments make this possible?</h3>
        <p>
            In 2022, Australia is expected to spend $18.7 billion on public cloud services. According to research
            conducted by Gartner, a Sydney based technological research firm, the increase in spending was seen
            throughout the pandemic and will continue to grow as businesses and organisations respond to new business
            dynamic(2). Gartner also said that the continuous expansion of the market will further accelerate cloud
            shift as it brings public cloud services into domains that have primarily been non-cloud(3).
        </p>
        <p>
            Tech Journal(4) says that since more and more companies are switching to remote facilities, 80 percent of
            business are expected to go to the cloud. It is also expected that data security will be improved
            significantly by 2025. With the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the cloud, it
            will be easier to automate the monitoring and defence process necessary for good data security.
        </p>
        <p>
            With most of our data being stored and run in the cloud, these become vulnerable to data breaches.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>
            As businesses increasingly move towards the cloud, businesses and their customers will see both benefits and
            risks. Jigsaw Academy(5) says that the move to the cloud helps in the reduction of company expenses as IT
            resources are purchased only when they are needed and the payment is made accordingly. They also state that
            cloud computing provides greater flexibility and allows users to switch from one cloud provider to another
            and expand or contract their capacity depending upon their requirements and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trend has accelerated because of the COVID-19 pandemic with many offices using hybrid working
            environments or shifting to virtual offices. Even now with loosening public health restrictions, this trend
            is expected to continue. Furthermore, innovative tools are being developed to allow workers to work more
            efficiently at home from their mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two articles from 2012 provide a grim outlook as to how cloud computing will affect employment in the
            future. However, IBM(6) argues that as people learn to harness these technologies, the cloud will enable
            many people to start up business to implement and sell ideas. IBM further argues that it was more difficult
            to implement a lot of ideas without the cloud. Eventually, these start-up businesses may grow into larger
            enterprises that will hire many employees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Employers moving to the cloud will look for employees that are knowledgeable about automation. Milind
            Govekar, the chief of research at Gartner, refers to automation as the ‘centrepiece of cloud business
            strategies”. He also states “Automation changes the entire mindset of the IT organisation, particularly the
            infrastructure and operations organization, where they need to stop being administrators and become
            programmers – completely different skillsets.” By 2025, the demand for low-code and no-code tools will
            triple as they become the more convenient for businesses to launch products to the cloud in a timely manner.

        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
        <h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h4>
        <p>
            These developments have already made a huge impact on my daily life. Instead of waking up very early in the
            morning to get ready for work and waste time in traffic, I now have the option to work from the comfort of
            my home office. I spend the time I save looking after myself and my family. I take that time to clear my
            mind and focus on my work. I am able to spend more time for my personal growth and development, going to the
            gym, and attending university.
        </p>
        <h4>What will be different for you?</h4>
        <p>
            Big four companies in Australia have now expanded their remote work from working from home to working
            internationally. Employees who wish to visit their home countries are able to take their laptops with them
            and still keep up with their roles. This will allow me and my colleagues to work in an environment where we
            all feel less stressed and would lead to interactions with each other that are more productive and open.
        </p>
        <h4>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
        <p>
            The availability of cloud infrastructure will allow my family and friends to expand their business’ markets
            without significant capital expenditure. Cloud infrastructure will make their business plans accessible. The
            Philippines does not have the same access to infrastructure, but the ability to rent centralised processing
            and data storage may remove barriers to entry for people in developing countries.
