        <h1>Blockchain & Crypto</h1>
        <h2>Molly Murray</h2>

        <br />

        <p>
            Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency which allows people to make payments directly to each other
            through a decentralised online system. This system is called the blockchain, which is a digitally
            distributed, public ledger that exists across a network, recording and storing information in a way that
            makes it almost impossible to change, cheat or hack the system. The blockchain does not store any of its
            information in a central location; instead, the data is copied and spread across a range of networks that
            make up the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrencies are generated through a process called mining, which uses computing power to help validate
            transactions by solving complex cryptographic hash puzzles which add blocks to the blockchain. Every
            computer on the network will then update to reflect this change. The way cryptocurrencies are valued depends
            on what people are willing to pay for them in the market, as they have no legislated or intrinsic value. As
            a result of this, the worth of these digital assets fluctuates constantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The blockchain continues to become more competitive as new ideas, currencies and technologies are introduced
            to the space, but in terms of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum proves to be of the state of the art of current
            blockchain technologies. Ethereum was the second largest coin created after bitcoin, with improvements in
            the fundamental design, which made its processes significantly more efficient as the technology continued to
            improve.
        </p>
        <p>
            A recent study shows that 76% of financial institutions intend to use cryptocurrencies in the next three
            years; however, a new technology that experts are interested in seeing grow over the next few years is NFTs.
            Non-fungible tokens exist on a blockchain and are created using the same type of programming for
            cryptocurrencies. These unique digital tokens recently took off, with many tech investors seeing huge
            profits but experts are still sceptical about if this bubble will eventually burst. However, NFTs still have
            the potential to be infinitely valuable in a number of industries, increasing security and processing costs
            for transactions. The blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies, cryptographic keys and a
            peer-to-peer network that contains a shared ledger. This is a means of computing that stores the records and
            transactions of the network. The technology has constantly been evolving since the creation of bitcoin,
            developing new and unique properties. It was created with the help of bringing together multiple existing
            technologies and assembling them in a new way; those included concepts that involved cryptography, game
            theory, algorithms, and economics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrencies can have a significant impact on the economy, with past examples suggesting that harnessing
            crypto effectively can reap economic benefits through investment, innovation, jobs, and taxes. From a
            business perspective adopting crypto as a digital asset can give businesses access to new demographics and
            make their technical and financial management systems more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            As official government entities work out a legal framework and taxation system for cryptocurrencies and the
            blockchain, it is possible they could eventually find their way into the wallets of consumers on a large
            scale. Although Bitcoin is now an official currency in the Central African Republic, the transactions have
            been made illegal in China, so global unity on united crypto regulation seems unlikely, at least for the
            short term. The Australian government has recently announced a significant step toward regulating bitcoin
            and other cryptocurrencies as we are set to be the first country to do a virtual stocktake of the
            cryptocurrency sector. They will initially be focusing on grouping types of crypto assets which has been
            called the "first step in a reform agenda".
        </p>
        <p>
            The people that will most likely be significantly impacted are those that work in relevant jobs and
            industries to cryptocurrencies, such as finance and business. One of the most consequential impacts of the
            rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology on the job market will be the shift from traditional
            finance and banking to financial technology or fintech, which may make many of the more conventional banking
            jobs redundant. As the blockchain is centralised and runs and exists from the user's computer, the system is
            much simpler and does not require as much, if any, assistance from a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will most likely not have a significant effect on me for at least a few
            years until crypto is more regulated and considered a mainstream currency. However, the success of
            cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum and whether their value increases or decreases will affect me
            as I purchased small amounts of them around five years ago when I first learned about the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
            If crypto became a regulated and mainstream currency, it would impact my daily life in terms of how I pay
            for things, send money to people, and travel. My money would most likely not be kept in a bank as people who
            own cryptocurrencies usually store them in some form of wallet, which can be online or offline. Travelling
            would also be very different; a centralised currency would mean exchange rates between other foreign
            currencies would not exist. Cash would also most likely not be used as all transactions would be made and
            documented digitally. When purchasing things and sending money to friends, I would also send money directly
            to their accounts; therefore, EFTPOS fees and bank fees would be significantly reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be different for me as I am not used to using crypto in everyday life and would probably struggle
            with the currency's instability. I also don't entirely trust crypto and prefer to keep my savings in a bank
            account or cash rather than in a crypto wallet. This technology would impact those of my family and friends
            who work in the field of finance as this would most likely involve a global redesign of finance systems
            everywhere, thereby making a considerable change to the economy and the finance industry. The blockchain is
            also a concept that can be very difficult to understand and has a lot of stigma surrounding privacy and
            security, so it would be a huge adjustment for my friends and family, and specifically for older family
            members, to adapt to a new system.
